# MigrationService

The `MigrationService` class provides functionality for migrating data from one version to another in the ISynergy.Framework.UI.Maui application.

## Usage

To use the `MigrationService`, follow these steps:

1. Create an instance of the `MigrationService` class:
2. Call the `Migrate` method to perform the migration:
This method will automatically detect the current version of the application and apply any necessary migrations to bring the data up to the latest version.

## Use Cases

### Migrating Data

The primary use case of the `MigrationService` is to migrate data from one version to another. This is useful when you have made changes to the data model and need to update existing data to match the new schema.

To migrate data, simply call the `Migrate` method as described in the usage section. The `MigrationService` will handle the rest, applying any necessary migrations to bring the data up to the latest version.

### Rolling Back Migrations

In some cases, you may need to roll back a migration and revert the data to a previous version. The `MigrationService` provides a `Rollback` method for this purpose.

To roll back a migration, call the `Rollback` method:
This will undo the last migration that was applied and revert the data to the previous version.

## Sample Code

Here is an example of how to use the `MigrationService` in a console application:
This code creates an instance of the `MigrationService` and calls the `Migrate` method to perform the migration. After the migration is complete, you can continue with the rest of your application logic.
