# MaxConcurrentRequestsLimitExceededPolicy Enumeration

This code defines an enumeration called MaxConcurrentRequestsLimitExceededPolicy, which is used to specify different policies for handling situations where the maximum number of concurrent requests has been exceeded in an ASP.NET Core application.

The purpose of this enumeration is to provide a set of predefined options that developers can choose from when configuring how their application should behave when it receives more simultaneous requests than it can handle. By using an enumeration, the code ensures that only valid policy options can be selected, reducing the chance of errors.

This enumeration doesn't take any inputs or produce any outputs directly. Instead, it serves as a type definition that can be used elsewhere in the application to represent the chosen policy.

The enumeration defines three possible policies:

- Drop (value 0): This policy simply drops any new requests that exceed the concurrent request limit.

- FifoQueueDropTail (value 1): This policy uses a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue to manage excess requests. When the queue is full, it drops the newest request (the "tail" of the queue).

- FifoQueueDropHead (value 2): This policy also uses a FIFO queue, but when the queue is full, it drops the oldest request (the "head" of the queue).

By providing these options, the enumeration allows developers to choose how their application should prioritize requests when under high load. For example, if they want to ensure that the oldest requests are always processed, they might choose the FifoQueueDropTail policy. If they want to prioritize newer requests, they might choose FifoQueueDropHead.

The enumeration achieves its purpose by giving meaningful names and unique integer values to each policy option. This makes it easy for other parts of the application to refer to these policies in a clear and type-safe manner.

While this code doesn't contain any complex logic or data transformations, it plays an important role in structuring the application's approach to handling high-load situations. It provides a foundation for implementing more complex request handling logic elsewhere in the application.
