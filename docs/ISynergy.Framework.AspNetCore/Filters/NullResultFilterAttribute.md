# NullResultFilterAttribute

This code defines a custom filter attribute called NullResultFilterAttribute, which is used in ASP.NET Core applications to handle specific scenarios in HTTP responses. The main purpose of this filter is to check if the response content is null and, if so, change the HTTP status code from 200 (OK) to 404 (Not Found).

The filter doesn't take any direct inputs from the user. Instead, it works with the context of the HTTP request and response that is automatically provided by the ASP.NET Core framework when the filter is applied to an action method or controller.

In terms of output, this filter doesn't produce any data directly. Instead, it can modify the HTTP response that will be sent back to the client. Specifically, it can change the response from a 200 OK status with a null content to a 404 Not Found status.

The filter achieves its purpose through a method called OnActionExecuted, which is called after an action method in a controller has been executed. This method examines the current state of the response and makes decisions based on what it finds.

The logic flow of the filter works like this:

- It first checks if the response status code is already 200 OK. If it's not, the filter does nothing and exits.
- Then it checks if the result of the action is an ObjectResult (a type used to represent object data in responses). If it's not, the filter does nothing and exits.
- If both these conditions are met, it then checks if the Value property of the ObjectResult is null.
- If the Value is null, it changes the result to a NotFoundResult, which will cause the response to have a 404 Not Found status instead of 200 OK.

This filter is useful in scenarios where an action method might return null to represent that a requested resource wasn't found, but you want to consistently represent this as a 404 Not Found status rather than a 200 OK status with null content. This can help clients of your API understand more clearly when a requested resource is not available.
