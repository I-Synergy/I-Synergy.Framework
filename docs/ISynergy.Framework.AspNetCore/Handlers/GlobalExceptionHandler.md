# GlobalExceptionHandler

This code defines a class called GlobalExceptionHandler, which is designed to handle exceptions that occur in an ASP.NET Core application. Its main purpose is to catch any unhandled exceptions, log them, and return a standardized error response to the client.

The GlobalExceptionHandler takes two inputs when it's created: a logger (for recording error information) and a problemDetailsFactory (for creating structured error responses). It implements the IExceptionHandler interface, which means it has a method called TryHandleAsync that gets called when an exception occurs.

When an exception happens, the TryHandleAsync method is invoked with three parameters: the HttpContext (which contains information about the current request and response), the Exception that occurred, and a CancellationToken (used for cancelling long-running operations if needed).

The method performs several steps to handle the exception:

- It logs the error using the provided logger, with a simple message "Whoopsie" along with the exception details.

- It creates a ProblemDetails object using the problemDetailsFactory. This object contains structured information about the error, including a status code of 500 (Internal Server Error) and the exception message.

- It sets the response's content type to "application/problem+json", which is a standard format for API error responses.

- It sets the response's status code to 500 (matching the ProblemDetails object).

- Finally, it writes the ProblemDetails object as JSON to the response body.

The method always returns true, indicating that it has successfully handled the exception.

The main logic flow is straightforward: log the error, create a structured error response, and send it back to the client. This approach ensures that all unhandled exceptions in the application result in a consistent, informative error response, which is helpful for both developers and API consumers.

In simple terms, this code acts like a safety net, catching any unexpected errors in your web application and turning them into user-friendly error messages, while also making sure the developers know about the problem so they can fix it.
