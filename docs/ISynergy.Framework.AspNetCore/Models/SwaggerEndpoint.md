# SwaggerEndpoint.cs

This code defines a class called SwaggerEndpoint, which is designed to represent information about a Swagger endpoint in an ASP.NET Core application. Swagger is a tool used for documenting and testing APIs, and this class helps organize the details needed to describe a specific Swagger endpoint.

The purpose of this code is to create a structure that can hold three pieces of information about a Swagger endpoint: its URL (Endpoint), a description of what it does (Description), and its version number (Version).

This class doesn't take any inputs directly or produce any outputs on its own. Instead, it serves as a blueprint for creating objects that can store and provide access to Swagger endpoint information. Other parts of the application can create instances of this class and set or retrieve the values for each property.

The SwaggerEndpoint class achieves its purpose by using C# properties. It defines three public properties:

- Endpoint: This is of type Uri, which represents a URL where the Swagger documentation can be accessed.
- Description: This is a string that provides a brief explanation of what the endpoint does or represents.
- Version: This is of type Version, which can store the version number of the API or Swagger documentation.

There isn't any complex logic or data transformation happening within this class. It's a simple data structure, often referred to as a "model" or "POCO" (Plain Old CLR Object). Its main job is to group related pieces of information together in a organized way.

When other parts of the application need to work with Swagger endpoint information, they can create an instance of this class, set the values for each property, and then use or pass around that instance as needed. This helps keep the code organized and makes it easier to manage information about different Swagger endpoints in the application.
