# IEmailSender.cs

This code defines an interface called IEmailSender, which outlines a contract for sending emails in an application. An interface in C# is like a blueprint that describes what methods a class should have, without providing the actual implementation.

The purpose of this interface is to standardize the way email sending functionality is implemented across the application. It ensures that any class that implements this interface will have consistent methods for sending emails.

The interface doesn't take any inputs directly, but it defines two methods that will accept inputs when implemented:

- SendEmailAsync: This method is designed to send an email asynchronously. It takes three string parameters: the recipient's email address, the subject of the email, and the message content.

- SendEmailFromAsync: This method is similar to SendEmailAsync, but it's likely intended for sending emails from a specific sender. It also takes the same three string parameters: email, subject, and message.

Both methods are declared to return a Task, which indicates that they will operate asynchronously. This means the methods can be awaited and won't block the main thread of the application while sending emails.

The interface doesn't produce any direct outputs, as it's just a contract. The actual output (sending an email) will happen in the classes that implement this interface.

The IEmailSender interface doesn't contain any logic or algorithms itself. Its purpose is to define a structure that other classes must follow. When a class implements this interface, it will need to provide the actual code for sending emails, which could involve connecting to an email server, formatting the email, and handling any errors that might occur during the sending process.

By using this interface, the application can easily switch between different email sending implementations (like using different email services) without changing the code that uses the email sender. This promotes flexibility and maintainability in the application's design.
