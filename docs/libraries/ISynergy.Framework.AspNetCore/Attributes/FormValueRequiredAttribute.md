# FormValueRequiredAttribute

This code defines a custom attribute called FormValueRequiredAttribute, which is used in ASP.NET Core applications to add a specific constraint to action methods in controllers. The purpose of this attribute is to ensure that a particular form value is present in the request before allowing the action method to be executed.

The attribute takes one input: a string parameter called "name" in its constructor. This name represents the key of the form value that should be present in the request.

While the attribute itself doesn't produce a direct output, it affects the behavior of the action method selection process in ASP.NET Core. It determines whether a specific action method should be considered as a candidate for handling the current request based on the presence of the required form value.

The attribute achieves its purpose by inheriting from ActionMethodSelectorAttribute and overriding the IsValidForRequest method. This method is called by the ASP.NET Core framework when it's trying to determine which action method should handle an incoming request.

The IsValidForRequest method (which is not fully shown in the provided code snippet) would typically check if the request meets certain conditions. It would likely examine the HTTP method of the request, the content type, and whether the specified form value (stored in the _name field) is present in the request's form data.

By using this attribute, developers can create more specific routing rules for their action methods. For example, they could ensure that a particular action is only executed when a specific form field is submitted, adding an extra layer of control over how requests are handled in their application.
