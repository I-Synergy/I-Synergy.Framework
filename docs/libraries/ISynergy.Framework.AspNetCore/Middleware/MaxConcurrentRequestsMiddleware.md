# MaxConcurrentRequestsMiddleware

This code defines a middleware class called MaxConcurrentRequestsMiddleware, which is designed to limit the number of concurrent requests that a web application can handle. The purpose of this middleware is to prevent the server from becoming overwhelmed by too many simultaneous requests, which could lead to performance issues or crashes.

The middleware takes two main inputs: a RequestDelegate (which represents the next middleware in the pipeline) and an IOptions (which contains configuration options for the middleware). It doesn't produce a direct output, but it controls whether incoming requests are processed immediately, queued, or rejected.

The class has several private fields:

- _concurrentRequestsCount: Keeps track of the current number of requests being processed.
- _next: Stores the next middleware in the pipeline.
- _options: Holds the configuration options for the middleware.
- _enqueuer: An optional component that handles queueing requests when the limit is exceeded.

The middleware achieves its purpose by maintaining a count of concurrent requests and comparing it to a configured limit. When a new request comes in, the middleware checks if processing it would exceed the limit. If not, it increments the count and allows the request to proceed. If the limit would be exceeded, the middleware either queues the request (if configured to do so) or rejects it with a 503 Service Unavailable status.

The important logic flow happens in the constructor and the Invoke method (which is not fully shown in this snippet). The constructor initializes the middleware with the provided options and sets up the _enqueuer if needed. The Invoke method (when implemented) would handle the actual request processing, including checking the limit, potentially queueing requests, and managing the concurrent request count.

This middleware is particularly useful for applications that need to control resource usage or maintain a certain level of performance under high load. By limiting concurrent requests, it helps prevent the server from becoming overloaded and ensures a more stable and responsive application.
