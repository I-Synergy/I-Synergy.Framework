# ErrorViewModel.cs

This code defines a class called ErrorViewModel, which is designed to represent and store information about errors that occur in a web application. The purpose of this class is to provide a structured way to handle and display error information to users or developers when something goes wrong in the application.

The ErrorViewModel class doesn't take any direct inputs when it's created. Instead, it has properties that can be set to store different pieces of information about an error. These properties include:

- Error: A string that holds the main error message.
- ErrorDescription: A string that provides a more detailed description of the error.
- RequestId: A string that stores a unique identifier for the request that caused the error.

The class doesn't produce any direct outputs. Instead, it serves as a container for error information that can be used by other parts of the application to display or log error details.

The ErrorViewModel achieves its purpose by providing a simple structure to organize error-related data. It uses properties with getters and setters, allowing other parts of the application to easily set or retrieve error information. The class also includes a computed property called ShowRequestId, which returns true if the RequestId is not empty or null, indicating whether the request identifier should be displayed.

An important feature of this class is the use of the [Description] attribute on the Error and ErrorDescription properties. These attributes likely provide human-readable labels for these properties, which could be used in user interfaces or error reports to make the information more understandable.

The class doesn't contain any complex logic or data transformations. Its main purpose is to serve as a data structure for holding error information in a organized and easily accessible manner. This structure can then be used by other parts of the application to handle errors consistently, whether that's displaying error messages to users, logging error details for developers, or passing error information between different components of the application.
