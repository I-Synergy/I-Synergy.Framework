# IBaseViewModel Interface Explanation:

The IBaseViewModel interface, defined in the file src\ISynergy.Framework.AspNetCore\ViewModels\Base\IBaseViewModel.cs, serves as a blueprint for creating view models in an ASP.NET Core application. A view model is a component that holds and manages data for a view (the user interface) in a web application.

The purpose of this interface is to define a common set of properties and methods that all view models in the application should implement. It doesn't contain any actual code implementation but rather outlines what features a class must have if it wants to be considered a "base view model" in this system.

This interface doesn't take any direct inputs or produce any outputs on its own. Instead, it declares what inputs and outputs the classes implementing this interface should handle.

The IBaseViewModel interface achieves its purpose by declaring two key elements:

- An InitializeAsync() method: This method is intended to be used for any asynchronous initialization tasks that a view model might need to perform. It returns a Task, which means it can be awaited and allows for non-blocking initialization operations.

- A Title property: This is a read-only string property that is meant to represent the title of the view associated with this view model.

Additionally, the interface inherits from IDisposable, which means any class implementing IBaseViewModel must also implement a Dispose() method. This is useful for cleaning up resources when the view model is no longer needed.

The logic flow in classes implementing this interface would typically involve calling InitializeAsync() when the view model is created, accessing the Title property when needed to display a title, and calling Dispose() when the view model is no longer needed.

By defining this interface, the code establishes a consistent structure for view models in the application. This can help maintain code organization, ensure all view models have necessary features, and make it easier to work with different view models in a uniform way throughout the application.
