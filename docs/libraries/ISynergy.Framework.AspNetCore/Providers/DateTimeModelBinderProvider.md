# DateTimeModelBinderProvider

This code defines a class called DateTimeModelBinderProvider, which is responsible for providing a custom model binder for DateTime values in an ASP.NET Core application. The purpose of this code is to help the framework correctly bind DateTime values from incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate model properties in the application.

The class takes one input when it's created: a DateTimeKind value. This specifies how the DateTime values should be interpreted (e.g., as local time, UTC time, or unspecified). This input is stored in a private field called specifiedKind for later use.

The main output of this class is an IModelBinder object, which is returned by the GetBinder method. This binder is used by the ASP.NET Core framework to convert incoming string values into DateTime objects.

The class achieves its purpose through two main parts:

- The constructor: When a new DateTimeModelBinderProvider is created, it checks if the provided DateTimeKind is valid using the EnumUtility.ThrowIfUndefined method. If it's not valid, an exception is thrown. This ensures that only proper DateTime kinds are used.

- The GetBinder method: This method is called by the ASP.NET Core framework when it needs to bind a DateTime value. It checks if the model type is either DateTime or nullable DateTime. If so, it returns a new DateTimeModelBinder with the specified DateTimeKind. If not, it returns null, indicating that this provider can't handle the given type.

The important logic flow here is the decision-making process in the GetBinder method. It determines whether to provide a custom binder based on the type of the model being bound. This allows the application to have fine-grained control over how DateTime values are parsed and interpreted, which can be crucial for applications dealing with dates and times, especially when working across different time zones.

In simple terms, this code acts like a specialized factory for DateTime binders. When the ASP.NET Core framework encounters a DateTime in the incoming data, it asks this provider if it can handle it. If it can, the provider creates a special tool (the DateTimeModelBinder) to convert the incoming string into a DateTime object, taking into account the specified kind of DateTime (like UTC or local time).
