# HtmlHelperExtensions.cs

This code defines a static class called HtmlHelperExtensions, which is designed to provide additional functionality for working with HTML in an ASP.NET Core application. The main purpose of the code shown is to determine the content type of an image file based on its file extension.

The code includes a private static method called GetFileContentType. This method takes a single input: a string representing the file path of an image. It then examines the file extension to determine the appropriate MIME type (content type) for the image.

The method uses a series of if statements to check the file extension. It looks for common image file types such as JPG, GIF, PNG, and WEBP. When it finds a match, it returns the corresponding MIME type as a string. For example, if the file ends with ".JPG" (case-insensitive), it returns "image/jpeg".

The logic flow of the GetFileContentType method is straightforward. It checks each file extension in turn, using the EndsWith method with a case-insensitive comparison. This means it will recognize the extension regardless of whether it's uppercase or lowercase. If a match is found, the appropriate MIME type is immediately returned.

If none of the recognized file extensions are found, the method throws an ArgumentException with the message "Unknown file type". This helps to ensure that only supported image types are processed.

The output of this method is a string representing the MIME type of the image file. This MIME type can be used in various web-related tasks, such as setting the correct Content-Type header when serving images or creating data URLs for inline images.

While not shown in the provided code snippet, this GetFileContentType method is likely used as part of a larger system for handling and displaying images in a web application. It provides a crucial step in correctly identifying the type of image being processed, which is essential for proper rendering and handling of images on web pages.
