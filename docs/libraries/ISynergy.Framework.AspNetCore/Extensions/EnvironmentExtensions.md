# EnviromentExtensions.cs

The IsDocker method for IWebHostEnvironment:

This method is an extension method for the IWebHostEnvironment interface. Its purpose is to determine whether the current environment is running in a Docker container.

The method takes one input: an IWebHostEnvironment object, which represents the web hosting environment for the application. This object contains information about the environment in which the application is running.

The output of this method is a boolean value (true or false). It returns true if the environment is Docker, and false otherwise.

To achieve its purpose, the method uses a simple logic:

- It calls the IsEnvironment method on the input environment object, passing the string "Docker" as an argument.
- If IsEnvironment("Docker") returns true, the method immediately returns true.
- If IsEnvironment("Docker") returns false, the method continues to the next line and returns false.
The important logic flow here is the if statement. It checks if the environment is specifically set to "Docker". This check is likely based on some configuration or setting in the application that identifies when it's running in a Docker container.

In simpler terms, this method acts like a question asker. It's as if it's asking the environment, "Are you Docker?" If the answer is yes, it tells us "true". If the answer is no, it tells us "false". This can be useful for developers who want to run different code or apply different settings when their application is running inside a Docker container versus when it's not.
