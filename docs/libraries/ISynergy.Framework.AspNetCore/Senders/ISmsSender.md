# ISmsSender.cs

This code defines an interface called ISmsSender, which is designed to provide a standardized way for sending SMS (Short Message Service) messages in an application.

The purpose of this interface is to create a contract that any class implementing SMS sending functionality must follow. It doesn't contain the actual implementation of sending SMS messages, but rather defines what methods should be available for sending SMS.

The interface declares a single method called SendSmsAsync. This method takes two inputs:

- number: A string representing the phone number to which the SMS will be sent.
- message: A string containing the content of the SMS message.

The SendSmsAsync method doesn't produce any direct output. Instead, it returns a Task, which indicates that this method is designed to be used asynchronously. This means that the SMS sending operation can be performed without blocking other operations in the application.

The purpose of this interface is achieved by providing a consistent structure for SMS sending functionality across different parts of an application or even different implementations. Any class that implements this interface must provide the actual logic for sending SMS messages, but the interface ensures that the method signature remains consistent.

While there's no specific logic flow or data transformation happening within the interface itself, it sets the stage for how SMS sending should be handled in the application. The async nature of the method suggests that the actual implementation will likely involve some form of network communication or external service interaction to send the SMS, which can take time and is best handled asynchronously.

By using this interface, developers can create different implementations for sending SMS messages (e.g., using different SMS service providers) while maintaining a consistent way to call the SMS sending functionality throughout the application. This promotes flexibility and easier maintenance of the codebase.
