# IntrospectionOptions.cs

This code defines a class called IntrospectionOptions, which is designed to store configuration settings related to introspection in an ASP.NET Core application. Introspection is typically used in authentication and authorization processes, particularly when working with OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect protocols.

The purpose of this code is to create a structure for holding three important pieces of information: an Issuer, a ClientId, and a ClientSecret. These are commonly used in authentication scenarios to identify and verify the authenticity of a client application when it's trying to access protected resources.

This class doesn't take any inputs directly or produce any outputs. Instead, it's meant to be used as a container for configuration data. Other parts of the application can create an instance of IntrospectionOptions and set values for its properties.

The class achieves its purpose by declaring three public properties:

- Issuer: This typically represents the entity that issues the tokens or credentials used for authentication.
- ClientId: This is usually a unique identifier for the client application.
- ClientSecret: This is a confidential key that the client application uses to prove its identity.

Each of these properties has both a getter and a setter (get; set;), which means other parts of the code can both read from and write to these properties.

There isn't any complex logic or data transformation happening in this code. It's a simple data structure, often referred to as a POCO (Plain Old CLR Object) in C#. The main flow here is that when an instance of IntrospectionOptions is created, these properties can be set with the appropriate values, and then other parts of the application can access these values when needed for authentication or authorization processes.

This type of class is commonly used with the Options Pattern in ASP.NET Core, which allows for strongly-typed access to groups of related settings. By defining these options in a separate class, it makes it easier to manage and configure authentication settings across different parts of an application.
