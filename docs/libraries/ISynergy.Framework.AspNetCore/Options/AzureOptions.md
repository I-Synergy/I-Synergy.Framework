# AzureOptions.cs

This code defines a class called AzureOptions, which is designed to store configuration settings for Azure services, particularly for Azure Active Directory (AD) and Azure Key Vault. The purpose of this code is to provide a structured way to hold and access these configuration options within an ASP.NET Core application.

The AzureOptions class doesn't take any direct inputs or produce any outputs. Instead, it serves as a container for storing important configuration data that can be used elsewhere in the application. This pattern is commonly used in ASP.NET Core for managing application settings.

The class contains two main pieces of information:

- TenantId: This is a string property that stores the Azure AD tenant identifier. In Azure, a tenant represents an organization and its associated Azure AD instance. The TenantId is crucial for authenticating and authorizing the application with Azure services.

- KeyVault: This is a nested class within AzureOptions that holds specific configuration details for Azure Key Vault, a service used for securely storing and accessing secrets (like passwords and API keys). The KeyVault class has three properties:

- KeyVaultUri: A Uri object representing the address of the Key Vault.
- ClientId: A string storing the client ID used for authenticating with the Key Vault.
- ClientSecret: A string containing the client secret, which acts like a password for accessing the Key Vault.

The code achieves its purpose by providing a clear structure for these configuration options. By organizing the data this way, other parts of the application can easily access and use these settings when interacting with Azure services.

While there's no complex logic or data transformation happening in this code, it's important to note that it follows object-oriented programming principles by encapsulating related data (Key Vault settings) within a nested class. This helps in organizing the code and makes it easier to manage and extend in the future if more Azure-related options need to be added.

In summary, this code sets up a blueprint for storing Azure configuration settings, making it simpler for developers to work with Azure services in their ASP.NET Core applications. It provides a standardized way to handle these settings across the application, promoting consistency and ease of use.
