# PostcodeApiOptions.cs

This code defines a class called PostcodeApiOptions, which is designed to store configuration settings for a postcode API (Application Programming Interface). The purpose of this class is to provide a structured way to hold and access important information needed to interact with a postcode service.

The PostcodeApiOptions class doesn't take any direct inputs or produce any outputs. Instead, it acts as a container for three pieces of information:

- Url: This is likely the web address where the postcode API can be accessed.
- Key: This is probably an authentication key or identifier required to use the API.
- Secret: This is likely a secret code or password that works alongside the key for secure access to the API.

Each of these pieces of information is represented by a property in the class. These properties are of type string, meaning they store text values. The class uses auto-implemented properties, which is a shorthand way in C# to create properties that can be both read from and written to.

The class achieves its purpose by providing a simple structure to organize and access these configuration details. When an instance of this class is created and its properties are set, it becomes easy for other parts of the program to retrieve the necessary information to connect to and use the postcode API.

There isn't any complex logic or data transformation happening within this class. Its main function is to act as a data container. The use of properties allows for potential future expansion, such as adding validation logic or changing how the data is stored without affecting other parts of the program that use this class.

The class is part of the ISynergy.Framework.AspNetCore.Options namespace, which suggests it's intended to be used within a larger framework for ASP.NET Core applications. This type of class is commonly used with dependency injection systems in .NET, allowing these configuration options to be easily shared across different parts of an application that need to interact with the postcode API.
