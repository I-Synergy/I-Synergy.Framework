# AuthenticationEndpointOptions.cs

This code defines a class called AuthenticationEndpointOptions, which is designed to store configuration settings for various authentication-related endpoints in a web application. The purpose of this class is to provide a structured way to manage and access the URLs or paths for different authentication processes.

The class doesn't take any direct inputs or produce any outputs. Instead, it acts as a container for storing important URL paths related to authentication. These paths can be set and retrieved by other parts of the application when needed.

The AuthenticationEndpointOptions class contains four properties, each representing a different authentication endpoint:

- TokenEndpointPath: This is where the application can obtain authentication tokens.
- AuthorizationEndpointPath: This is where users are directed to authorize access.
- LogoutEndpointPath: This is where users can go to log out of the application.
- UserinfoEndpointPath: This is where the application can retrieve information about the authenticated user.

Each of these properties is of type string, meaning they store text values. They are all initialized with an empty string (string.Empty) as a default value. This ensures that even if a specific path is not set, the property will still have a valid (albeit empty) value.

The class uses C# properties with both get and set accessors. This means other parts of the application can both read (get) and write (set) these values. For example, when setting up the authentication system, a developer might write code like this:

(var options = new AuthenticationEndpointOptions();
options.TokenEndpointPath = "/api/token";
options.AuthorizationEndpointPath = "/api/authorize";)

Later, when the application needs to use these paths, it can read them like this:

(string tokenPath = options.TokenEndpointPath;)

The main purpose of this class is to centralize and organize these important configuration values. By grouping related settings together in a single class, it becomes easier to manage and update these values throughout the application. This approach also allows for easy extension if more authentication-related paths need to be added in the future.
