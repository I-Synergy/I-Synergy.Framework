# CORSOptions.cs

This code defines a simple class called CORSOptions that is used to configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings in an ASP.NET Core application. CORS is a security feature implemented by web browsers to control access to resources (like APIs) from a different domain than the one serving the web page.

The purpose of this code is to provide a structure for storing allowed origins (domains) that can access resources from your web application. It doesn't perform any complex operations or transformations; instead, it acts as a container for configuration data.

The CORSOptions class has one property:

1. AllowedOrigins: This is an array of strings that represents the list of origins (domains) allowed to access resources from your application.
The class doesn't take any direct inputs or produce any outputs. Instead, it's typically used by other parts of the application, such as middleware or configuration services, to determine which origins should be allowed to make cross-origin requests.

To use this class, a developer would create an instance of CORSOptions and set the AllowedOrigins property with an array of domain names. For example:

(var corsOptions = new CORSOptions();
corsOptions.AllowedOrigins = new string[] { "https://example.com", "https://api.example.com" };)

This configuration would then be used elsewhere in the application to enforce CORS policies, allowing requests only from the specified domains.

The code achieves its purpose by providing a simple, clear structure for storing CORS configuration. By using a dedicated class for this purpose, it helps organize the application's configuration and makes it easier to manage CORS settings in a type-safe manner.

While there's no complex logic or data transformation happening within this class itself, it plays an important role in the overall security and functionality of a web application by helping to control which external domains can interact with your application's resources.
