# DataProtectionOptions.cs

This code defines a class called DataProtectionOptions which is designed to store configuration options for data protection in an ASP.NET Core application. The purpose of this class is to provide a structured way to hold and access important settings related to data protection, specifically for storing encryption keys.

The class doesn't take any direct inputs or produce any outputs. Instead, it acts as a container for two important pieces of information:

- ConnectionString: This is typically a string that contains the necessary information to connect to a storage service, such as Azure Blob Storage.
- KeyIdentifier: This is a string that helps identify or locate the specific encryption key within the storage service.

These properties can be set and retrieved as needed by other parts of the application that deal with data protection.

The DataProtectionOptions class implements an interface called IStorageOptions. This means it adheres to a contract that requires it to provide certain properties or methods, ensuring compatibility with other parts of the system that expect storage options.

The class doesn't contain any complex logic or algorithms. Its main purpose is to organize and store configuration data in a clean, accessible manner. This approach allows developers to easily manage and update data protection settings without having to modify code in multiple places throughout the application.

By using this class, developers can centralize the configuration for data protection, making it easier to maintain and update these important security settings. Other parts of the application can then use an instance of this class to retrieve the necessary information for connecting to the storage service and identifying the correct encryption key.
