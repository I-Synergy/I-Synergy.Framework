# RequestShouldBeLocalFilterAttribute

This code defines a custom filter attribute called RequestShouldBeLocalFilterAttribute, which is used in ASP.NET Core applications to ensure that certain actions or controllers can only be accessed from local requests.

The purpose of this code is to add a security layer to web applications by restricting access to specific parts of the application to only local requests. This means that only requests coming from the same machine or local network where the application is running will be allowed to proceed.

This filter doesn't take any direct inputs from the user. Instead, it automatically intercepts incoming HTTP requests before they reach the intended action method in a controller.

The output of this filter is either allowing the request to proceed normally (if it's a local request) or returning a "Forbidden" result (if it's not a local request).

The filter achieves its purpose by overriding the OnActionExecuting method, which is called before an action method is executed. Inside this method, it checks if the current request is local using the IsLocal() extension method. If the request is not local, it sets the context.Result to a new ForbidResult(), which effectively blocks the request and returns a "Forbidden" status.

The main logic flow in this code is quite simple:

- The filter intercepts an incoming request.
- It checks if the request is local.
- If the request is local, it does nothing, allowing the request to proceed.
- If the request is not local, it sets the result to "Forbidden," preventing further execution.

This filter is particularly useful for protecting sensitive parts of a web application that should only be accessible from the local environment, such as administrative interfaces or debugging tools. By applying this attribute to a controller or action method, developers can easily ensure that these protected areas cannot be accessed from external sources, adding an extra layer of security to their application.
