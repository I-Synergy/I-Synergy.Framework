# NoCacheFilterAttribute

This code defines a custom filter attribute called NoCacheFilterAttribute, which is used in ASP.NET Core applications to prevent caching of specific actions or controllers. The purpose of this filter is to ensure that certain responses from the server are not stored in the browser's cache, forcing the browser to always request fresh data from the server.

The NoCacheFilterAttribute doesn't take any direct inputs when it's applied to an action or controller. Instead, it works by intercepting the HTTP response after an action has been executed.

The output of this filter is a modification to the HTTP response headers. Specifically, it adds or modifies the Cache-Control header to indicate that the response should not be cached.

To achieve its purpose, the filter overrides the OnActionExecuted method from the ActionFilterAttribute base class. This method is called automatically by the ASP.NET Core framework after an action method has been executed but before the result is sent to the client.

The logic flow of the filter is straightforward:

- It first checks if the HTTP response object is available in the context.
- If the response object exists, it accesses the typed headers of the response.
- It then sets the CacheControl property of the headers to a new CacheControlHeaderValue object.
- This new object has its NoCache property set to true, which effectively tells the client (usually a web browser) not to cache the response.

By setting NoCache to true, the filter ensures that whenever a client requests this resource in the future, it will always make a new request to the server rather than using a cached version. This is particularly useful for dynamic content that changes frequently or for sensitive information that shouldn't be stored in a browser's cache.

In simple terms, this code acts like a "Do Not Save" stamp on the server's response, telling the browser, "Don't keep a copy of this, always ask me for a fresh version when you need it."
