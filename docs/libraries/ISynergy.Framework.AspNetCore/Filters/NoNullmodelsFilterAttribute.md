# NoNullModelsFilterAttribute

This code defines a custom filter attribute called NoNullModelsFilterAttribute, which is used in ASP.NET Core applications to validate model parameters in controller actions. The purpose of this filter is to ensure that required parameters are not null when an action is executed.

The filter takes input in the form of an ActionExecutingContext, which contains information about the current action being executed, including its parameters and arguments. It doesn't produce a direct output, but it modifies the ModelState of the context by adding error messages for any null required parameters.

Here's how the filter achieves its purpose:

- It first identifies optional parameters that have a default value of null. These parameters are allowed to be null and won't trigger an error.

- Then, it checks all the arguments passed to the action. If any argument is null and is not in the list of optional parameters, it's considered an error.

- For each null argument that's not optional, the filter adds an error message to the ModelState, indicating that the field is required.

The main logic flow involves two steps:

- Finding optional parameters: The filter looks at all parameters of the action and identifies those that are optional and have a default value of null. It stores the names of these parameters in a list.

- Checking for null arguments: The filter then examines all arguments passed to the action. If any argument is null and its name is not in the list of optional parameters, it's flagged as an error.

This filter is useful for ensuring data integrity in web applications. It helps prevent null values from being passed to action methods when they're not expected, which can lead to errors or unexpected behavior. By adding error messages to the ModelState, it also provides feedback to the user or calling code about what went wrong, making it easier to correct the issue.
