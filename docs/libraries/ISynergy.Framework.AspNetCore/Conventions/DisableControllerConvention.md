# DisabledControllerConvention.cs

This code defines a class called DisabledControllerConvention, which is designed to remove certain controllers from an ASP.NET Core application. The main purpose of this code is to disable controllers whose namespaces end with ".Disabled".

The class implements an interface called IApplicationModelConvention, which is part of ASP.NET Core's system for customizing how the application behaves. The main functionality is contained in the Apply method, which takes an ApplicationModel object as input. This ApplicationModel represents the entire structure of the web application, including all its controllers.

The Apply method doesn't produce any direct output. Instead, it modifies the input ApplicationModel by removing specific controllers from it. This change affects how the application will handle incoming requests, as the removed controllers will no longer be available to process those requests.

To achieve its purpose, the code uses a simple but effective algorithm:

- It starts a loop that goes through all the controllers in the application, starting from the last one and moving backwards.
- For each controller, it checks if the controller's namespace (the group it belongs to in the code structure) ends with ".Disabled".
- If a controller's namespace does end with ".Disabled", that controller is removed from the list of controllers in the application.
The backwards loop (from last to first) is used because removing items from a list while moving forward can cause issues with indexing. By going backwards, the code ensures that all controllers are checked and removed if necessary, without any problems.

An important aspect of this code is that it allows developers to easily disable entire groups of controllers just by putting them in a namespace that ends with ".Disabled". This can be useful for temporarily removing features from an application or for managing different versions of an API.

In summary, this code provides a simple way to automatically disable certain parts of a web application based on how they're named, without having to manually remove or comment out large sections of code.
