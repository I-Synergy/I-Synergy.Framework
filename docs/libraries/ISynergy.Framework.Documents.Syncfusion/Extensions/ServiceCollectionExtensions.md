# ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs

This code defines an extension method for configuring and setting up document-related services in an application, specifically for integrating Syncfusion document services. The purpose of this code is to make it easier for developers to add and configure these services in their applications.

The main input for this code is an IServiceCollection object, which is a collection of service descriptors used for dependency injection in .NET applications. It also takes an IConfiguration object, which provides access to application configuration settings, and an optional string parameter called "prefix" that defaults to an empty string.

The output of this code is the same IServiceCollection object, but with additional services and configurations added to it. This allows the method to be chained with other configuration methods.

The code achieves its purpose by performing several steps:

- It adds the ability to use options pattern in the application by calling AddOptions().
- It configures Syncfusion license options by binding the relevant section from the configuration to a SyncfusionLicenseOptions object.
- It registers two services: ILanguageService and IDocumentService, implementing them with LanguageService and DocumentService respectively. These are registered as singletons, meaning only one instance of each will be created and reused throughout the application's lifetime.

The important logic flow here is the use of extension methods to add these configurations and services. By extending IServiceCollection, this method can be called directly on a services object in the application's startup code, making it more convenient and readable.

The code also uses the TryAddSingleton method, which only adds the service if it hasn't been registered already. This prevents duplicate registrations and allows for potential overrides in other parts of the application.

Overall, this code simplifies the process of setting up Syncfusion document services in an application by encapsulating all the necessary configuration and service registration in a single, easy-to-use method.
