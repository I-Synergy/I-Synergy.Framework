# FileExtensions.cs

This code defines a static class called FileExtensions that provides utility methods for working with file names. The purpose of this code is to help validate and sanitize file names, ensuring they don't contain invalid characters that could cause problems when working with files in a computer system.

The code doesn't take any direct inputs or produce any outputs on its own. Instead, it defines methods that can be used on string objects representing file names. These methods can be called on any string to check if it's a valid file name or to make it valid.

The class achieves its purpose through two main methods:

- IsValidFileName: This method checks if a given string is a valid file name. It uses a regular expression (regex) to match against patterns of invalid characters or sequences in the file name. If the regex doesn't find a match, the file name is considered valid.

- MakeValidFileName: This method takes a string that might contain invalid characters for a file name and replaces those characters with underscores. This ensures that the resulting string is a valid file name.

The logic flow in this code revolves around the use of regular expressions. The class defines two private fields: invalidChars and invalidRegStr. The invalidChars field contains all the characters that are not allowed in file names on the current system. The invalidRegStr field is a regex pattern that matches either a sequence of invalid characters followed by dots at the end of the string, or any sequence of invalid characters anywhere in the string.

Both methods use this regex pattern to either check for validity (IsValidFileName) or replace invalid characters (MakeValidFileName). The regex operations are given a time limit of 100 milliseconds to prevent potential performance issues with very long strings.

In simple terms, this code provides a way to check if a file name is valid and to fix it if it's not. This is useful in many programming scenarios where you need to work with files and want to ensure that the file names you're using won't cause problems when saving or accessing files on the computer.
