# ResultExtensions.cs

This code defines a static class called ResultExtensions, which contains two extension methods named "Match". These methods are designed to work with Result and PaginatedResult objects, providing a convenient way to handle success and failure scenarios.

The purpose of these extension methods is to simplify the process of working with result objects. They allow developers to specify what should happen in both successful and unsuccessful cases, without having to write repetitive if-else statements.

Both Match methods take two inputs: the result object itself (either Result or PaginatedResult) and two functions. The first function defines what should happen if the operation was successful, and the second function defines what should happen if it failed.

The output of these methods is determined by the return type of the functions provided. Both successful and failure functions must return the same type, which is represented by TResult in the method signatures.

The logic in both methods is quite simple. They check if the operation succeeded by looking at the Succeeded property of the result object. If it's true, they call the success function with the Data from the result. If it's false, they call the failure function.

The main difference between the two methods is the type of data they work with. The first method is for single items (T), while the second is for collections of items (IEnumerable).

These extension methods achieve their purpose by providing a clean, functional way to handle different outcomes. Instead of writing if-else statements every time you need to check a result, you can use these Match methods to specify both scenarios in a single line of code.

In simple terms, these methods allow you to say "If this operation worked, do this with the result. If it didn't work, do this instead." This approach can make code more readable and reduce the chances of forgetting to handle error cases.
