# FloatExtensions.cs

This code defines a static class called FloatExtensions, which contains two extension methods for the float data type in C#. The purpose of this code is to provide additional functionality to float values, specifically for creating easing effects commonly used in animations or transitions.

The class contains two methods: EaseOut and EaseIn. Both methods take a single input, which is the float value they're being called on (represented by the parameter _self). They both return a float value as output.

The EaseOut method applies a cubic easing function to the input value. It achieves this by multiplying the input value by itself three times (_self * _self * _self). This creates a gradual slowing effect, where the rate of change decreases as the value approaches its final state. This is often used to create smooth deceleration in animations.

The EaseIn method, on the other hand, applies an inverse cubic easing function. It first decreases the input value by 1 (--_self), then multiplies this result by itself twice, and finally adds 1 to the result ((--_self) * _self * _self + 1). This creates an accelerating effect, where the rate of change increases as the value approaches its final state. It's commonly used to create smooth acceleration in animations.

Both methods transform the input value (which is typically between 0 and 1) to create a curved progression instead of a linear one. This allows for more natural-looking animations or transitions in user interfaces or graphics.

The code achieves its purpose by using simple mathematical operations to modify the input value. The key to understanding the logic is to imagine these functions applied to values between 0 and 1, where they create smooth curves instead of straight lines.

It's important to note that these methods are extension methods, which means they can be called directly on float values as if they were built-in methods of the float type. This makes the code more readable and intuitive to use in other parts of a program.
