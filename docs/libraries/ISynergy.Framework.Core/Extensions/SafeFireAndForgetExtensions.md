# SafeFireAndForgetExtensions

This code defines a set of extension methods called SafeFireAndForgetExtensions. The purpose of these extensions is to provide a safe way to execute asynchronous tasks without waiting for them to complete, a pattern known as "fire and forget."

The code introduces two main methods: SafeFireAndForget. These methods take a ValueTask as input, along with optional parameters for exception handling and context control. They don't produce a direct output, but instead, they allow the program to continue running while the task executes in the background.

The main goal of these extensions is to handle potential exceptions that might occur during the execution of asynchronous tasks. They do this by wrapping the task execution in a try-catch block (implemented in the HandleSafeFireAndForget method, which is called by both SafeFireAndForget methods).

The code achieves its purpose by providing two ways to handle exceptions:

- A global exception handler (_onException), which can be set for all SafeFireAndForget calls.
- A per-call exception handler (onException parameter), which can be specified for individual calls.

The extensions also allow control over whether the task should continue on the same context (thread) or switch to a different one, which is useful for managing UI responsiveness in applications.

An important aspect of the code is its use of generics in the second SafeFireAndForget method. This allows users to specify a particular type of exception they want to handle, providing more fine-grained control over error handling.

Overall, these extensions aim to make it easier and safer for programmers to use fire-and-forget patterns in their asynchronous code, helping to prevent unhandled exceptions and providing flexibility in how those exceptions are managed.
