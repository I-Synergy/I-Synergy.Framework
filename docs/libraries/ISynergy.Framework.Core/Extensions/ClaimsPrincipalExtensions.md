# ClaimsPrincipalExtensions

This code defines a static class called ClaimsPrincipalExtensions, which provides extension methods for working with claims in a ClaimsPrincipal object. Claims are pieces of information about a user, such as their username or user ID.

The main purpose of this code is to make it easier to retrieve and check for claims in a ClaimsPrincipal object. It provides two primary methods: GetClaims and HasClaim.

The GetClaims method takes two inputs: a ClaimsPrincipal object (which represents the current user) and a string representing the type of claim to look for. It returns a List of strings containing the values of all claims matching the specified type. If no matching claims are found, it throws a ClaimNotFoundException.

The HasClaim method also takes a ClaimsPrincipal object and a claim type string as inputs. It returns a boolean value: true if the specified claim type exists for the user, and false if it doesn't.

To achieve its purpose, the GetClaims method first accesses the Claims property of the ClaimsPrincipal object. It then uses the FindValues method (defined elsewhere in the class) to search for all claims of the specified type. If any matching claims are found, their values are returned as a list. If no matching claims are found, an exception is thrown.

The HasClaim method works similarly, but it uses the FindSingleValue method to look for just one claim of the specified type. If such a claim is found, the method returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

An important aspect of this code is its use of extension methods. By defining these methods as extensions, they can be called as if they were part of the ClaimsPrincipal class itself, making the code more intuitive and easier to use.

Overall, this code provides a convenient way for programmers to work with claims in their applications, abstracting away some of the complexity of dealing with ClaimsPrincipal objects directly.
