# DataColumnCollectionExtensions.cs

This code defines an extension method for the DataColumnCollection class, which is part of the System.Data namespace in C#. The purpose of this extension method is to make it easier to add multiple columns to a DataTable at once.

The extension method is called "Add" and it takes two inputs:

- A DataColumnCollection object (which is represented by the 'collection' parameter)
- An array of strings (represented by the 'columnNames' parameter)

The method doesn't produce any direct output, but it modifies the input DataColumnCollection by adding new columns to it.

The method achieves its purpose by using a simple for loop. It iterates through each string in the columnNames array and adds a new column to the collection for each name. This is done using the existing Add method of the DataColumnCollection, which creates a new column with the given name.

The main benefit of this extension method is that it allows programmers to add multiple columns to a DataTable in a single line of code, rather than having to write multiple lines to add each column individually. This can make the code more concise and easier to read.

For example, instead of writing:

table.Columns.Add("columnName1");
table.Columns.Add("columnName2");
table.Columns.Add("columnName3");

A programmer can now write:

table.Columns.Add("columnName1", "columnName2", "columnName3");

This extension method is particularly useful when working with DataTables that require many columns, as it can significantly reduce the amount of code needed to set up the table structure.
