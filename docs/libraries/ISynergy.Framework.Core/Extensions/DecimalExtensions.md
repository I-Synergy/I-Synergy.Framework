# DecimalExtensions.cs

This code defines a class called DecimalExtensions, which is an extension class for the decimal data type in C#. The main purpose of this code is to add a new method called IsNegative to decimal numbers, making it easier to check if a decimal value is negative or not.

The code takes a decimal number as input, which is represented by the 'self' parameter in the IsNegative method. This method is designed to work with any decimal number you want to check.

The output of this code is a boolean value (true or false). It returns true if the input decimal number is negative, and false if it's zero or positive.

The logic used to achieve this purpose is quite simple. The IsNegative method compares the input decimal (self) with zero. If the number is less than zero, it means it's negative, so the method returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

The important flow in this code is the if-statement that checks if the decimal is less than zero. This is the core logic that determines whether a number is negative or not.

By creating this extension method, the code allows programmers to easily check if a decimal number is negative without having to write the comparison logic every time. They can simply call the IsNegative() method on any decimal number, making their code cleaner and more readable.

For example, instead of writing "if (myDecimal < 0)", a programmer can now write "if (myDecimal.IsNegative())", which is more intuitive and self-explanatory. This extension method enhances the functionality of the decimal type in a way that's easy for beginners to understand and use.
