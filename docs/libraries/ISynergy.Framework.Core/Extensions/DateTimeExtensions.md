# DateTimeExtensions.cs

This code defines a static class called DateTimeExtensions, which contains extension methods for the DateTime type in C#. Extension methods allow you to add new methods to existing types without modifying the original type. In this case, the class adds two new methods to DateTime: Age and AgeInDays.

The Age method calculates a person's age based on their birthdate. It takes a DateTime object (representing the birthdate) as input and returns an integer representing the person's age in years. The method works by subtracting the birth year from the current year. It then checks if the current date is before the birthday in the current year. If so, it subtracts one year from the age, as the person hasn't had their birthday yet this year.

The AgeInDays method calculates the age of something in days. It also takes a DateTime object as input and returns an integer representing the number of days between the input date and the current date. This method subtracts the input date from the current date to get the total number of days, then rounds down to the nearest whole number.

Both methods use DateTime.Now to get the current date for comparison. The Age method performs date comparisons to accurately determine the age in years, while the AgeInDays method uses a simple subtraction and rounding to calculate the age in days.

These extension methods can be useful in various applications, such as calculating a person's age for forms or eligibility checks, or determining how many days have passed since a certain event. By extending the DateTime type, these methods can be called directly on any DateTime object, making them convenient and easy to use in code.
