# ReflectionExtensions.cs

This code defines a static class called ReflectionExtensions, which provides utility methods for working with reflection in C#. Reflection is a feature that allows programs to examine, interact with, and modify their own structure and behavior at runtime.

The main purpose of this code is to provide helper methods for identifying and working with properties in classes that have been marked with specific attributes. In this case, it focuses on properties marked with an IdentityAttribute.

The code includes two public static methods:

- GetIdentityPropertyName(): This method takes no input parameters but uses a generic type T. It returns a string, which is the name of the property marked with the IdentityAttribute in the given type T.

- GetIdentityValue(T _self): This method takes an input parameter _self of type T and returns an object, which is the value of the property marked with the IdentityAttribute in the given instance.

Both methods achieve their purpose by using reflection to examine the properties of the given type or instance. They look for properties that have been decorated with the IdentityAttribute.

The logic flow in both methods is similar:

- Get all properties of the type T using reflection.
- Filter these properties to find those marked with the IdentityAttribute.
- If any such properties are found, return the name (for GetIdentityPropertyName) or the value (for GetIdentityValue) of the first matching property.
- If no matching properties are found, return null.

These methods are useful for scenarios where you need to dynamically identify or retrieve values from properties that have been designated as "identity" properties in your classes, without knowing the exact property names in advance.

The code uses LINQ (Language Integrated Query) to perform the filtering of properties, which simplifies the logic and makes it more readable. It also uses generics to make the methods flexible and usable with any class type.

Overall, this code provides a convenient way to work with classes that use the IdentityAttribute, allowing for more dynamic and flexible handling of object identities in a program.
