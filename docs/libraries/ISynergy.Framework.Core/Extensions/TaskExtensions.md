# TaskExtensions.cs

This code defines a class called TaskExtensions, which is designed to provide additional functionality for working with tasks in C#. The main purpose of this code is to create a way to await tasks without performing end validation, which can be useful in certain scenarios.

The code introduces a new method called GetAwaitableWithoutEndValidation, which takes a Task as input. This method returns a custom struct called TaskAwaitableWithoutEndValidation, which wraps the original task.

The TaskAwaitableWithoutEndValidation struct is the key component of this code. It holds a reference to the original task and provides a way to create an awaiter for it. The awaiter is responsible for managing the asynchronous operation and allowing the code to continue when the task is complete.

The main logic of this code revolves around creating a custom awaitable object that behaves similarly to a regular task, but with one key difference: it skips the end validation. This means that when you await a task using this extension method, it won't throw exceptions if the task faulted or was canceled.

To achieve this, the code defines an inner struct called Awaiter within TaskAwaitableWithoutEndValidation. This Awaiter struct implements the necessary methods and properties to work with the C# await keyword, such as IsCompleted, GetResult, OnCompleted, and UnsafeOnCompleted.

The important thing to note is that the GetResult method of the Awaiter is empty. This is what allows it to skip the end validation. In a normal task, this method would check for exceptions or cancellation and throw if necessary. By leaving it empty, any errors or cancellations in the original task are effectively ignored.

In simple terms, this code provides a way to wait for a task to complete without worrying about whether it succeeded or failed. This can be useful in situations where you want to ensure some code runs after a task, regardless of its outcome, or when you're dealing with fire-and-forget operations where the result doesn't matter.
