# ConfigurationBinderExtensions.cs

This code defines a static class called ConfigurationBinderExtensions, which adds a new method to the IConfiguration interface in .NET. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to bind configuration values to an object and automatically update that object when the configuration changes.

The main functionality is provided by the BindWithReload method. This method takes two inputs: an IConfiguration object (which represents the application's configuration) and an instance of any object that should receive the configuration values.

The method doesn't produce a direct output. Instead, it modifies the input object by populating it with values from the configuration. The key feature is that it sets up a mechanism to automatically update the object whenever the configuration changes.

Here's how the method achieves its purpose:

- First, it calls configuration.Bind(instance), which copies the current configuration values into the properties of the instance object.

- Then, it sets up a callback using configuration.GetReloadToken().RegisterChangeCallback(). This callback will be triggered whenever the configuration is reloaded or changed.

- Inside the callback, it calls configuration.Bind(instance) again. This means that every time the configuration changes, the instance object will be updated with the new values.

The important logic flow here is the automatic updating mechanism. Instead of requiring the programmer to manually rebind the configuration every time it changes, this method sets up an automatic process. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where configuration might change at runtime, such as when using cloud configuration providers.

For a beginner programmer, you can think of this as setting up a "listener" that constantly watches for changes in the configuration. When it detects a change, it automatically updates your object with the new values, keeping everything in sync without any additional work on your part.
