# StreamReaderExtensions.cs

This code defines an extension method called GetPosition for the StreamReader class. The purpose of this method is to determine the current position of the reader within the underlying stream, which is not directly accessible through the standard StreamReader methods.

The method takes a single input: a StreamReader object. It doesn't require any additional parameters because it's an extension method, meaning it's called on an instance of StreamReader as if it were a built-in method.

The output of this method is a long value representing the current position of the reader in the stream. This position is measured as the number of bytes from the beginning of the stream to the current reading point.

To achieve its purpose, the method uses reflection to access private fields of the StreamReader class. Reflection allows the code to inspect and interact with parts of an object that are not normally accessible. This approach is used because the StreamReader class doesn't provide a direct way to get the exact position in the underlying stream.

The logic flow of the method is as follows:

- It retrieves three private fields from the StreamReader object: _charBuffer, _charPos, and _byteLen.
- It calculates the number of bytes that the already-read characters would occupy when encoded, using the current encoding of the reader.
- Finally, it computes the actual position by taking the current position of the base stream, subtracting the number of bytes in the buffer, and adding the number of bytes for the read characters.

This method is particularly useful when you need to know the exact byte position in a stream while reading text, which can be important for tasks like parsing or seeking within files. It provides a way to get this information that isn't available through the standard StreamReader interface.
