# DoubleExtensions Class Explanation:

The DoubleExtensions class is a set of helper methods designed to work with double-precision floating-point numbers (doubles) in C#. Its main purpose is to provide more accurate and reliable ways to compare and check properties of double values, which can be tricky due to the nature of floating-point arithmetic.

The class contains a constant called DefaultPrecision, which is set to a very small number (0.000000000001). This value is used as the default tolerance when comparing doubles for equality.

The main method in this class is IsApproximatelyEqual. This method takes two double values (a and b) as input, along with an optional precision value (delta). It returns a boolean (true or false) indicating whether the two input numbers are approximately equal within the given precision.

Here's how the IsApproximatelyEqual method works:

- First, it checks for special cases: if 'a' is Not a Number (NaN), it returns true only if 'b' is also NaN. Similarly, if 'a' is infinity, it returns true only if 'b' is also infinity.

- If the numbers are exactly equal, it returns true.

- If the numbers are not equal, it calculates a scale factor. This scale factor is 1.0 if either 'a' or 'b' is zero, otherwise it's the larger of the absolute values of 'a' and 'b'.

- Finally, it checks if the absolute difference between 'a' and 'b' is less than or equal to the scale factor multiplied by the precision (delta). If so, it considers the numbers approximately equal and returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

This method is useful because direct equality comparisons with doubles can be unreliable due to rounding errors in floating-point arithmetic. By using a scale factor and a small precision value, this method provides a more robust way to check if two doubles are effectively the same value.

The class sets up a framework for additional methods to be added, which could provide more ways to work with and compare double values accurately.
