# BitmapExtensions.cs

This code defines a static class called BitmapExtensions, which provides a method to convert bitmap images from one format to another. The main purpose of this code is to offer a convenient way to transform image data while also allowing control over the quality of the output image.

The primary method in this class is ToImageBytes. It takes three inputs: a byte array representing a bitmap image, a long value for quality, and an ImageFormat to specify the desired output format. The method produces a byte array as output, which contains the image data in the new format.

Here's how the method achieves its purpose:

- It starts by creating a MemoryStream to store the result and gets an encoder for the specified image format.
- It sets up encoder parameters to control the quality of the output image.
- If no suitable encoder is found for the given format, it throws an exception.
- It then creates an Image object from the input byte array.
- Finally, it saves the image to the MemoryStream using the specified encoder and quality settings, and returns the result as a byte array.

The important logic flow in this code involves the conversion process from the input bitmap to the output image format. It uses the System.Drawing namespace to handle image processing, which allows for versatile image manipulations.

A key data transformation occurs when the input byte array is converted into an Image object, processed, and then converted back into a byte array in the new format. This transformation enables the change in image format and quality adjustment.

The code also includes a private helper method, GetEncoder, which finds the appropriate ImageCodecInfo for a given ImageFormat. This method is used internally to get the correct encoder for the image conversion process.

Overall, this code provides a useful tool for developers who need to convert images between different formats programmatically, with the added benefit of being able to control the quality of the output image.
