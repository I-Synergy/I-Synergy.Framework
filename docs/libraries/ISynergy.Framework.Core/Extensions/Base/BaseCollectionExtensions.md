# BaseCollectionExtensions

BaseCollectionExtensions is a static class that provides methods to convert collections into DataTables. Here's a simple explanation of what this code does:

- Purpose: The main purpose of this code is to provide a way to convert various types of collections into DataTable objects. DataTables are useful for representing tabular data, which can be helpful in scenarios like data binding or data manipulation.

- Inputs: The code takes two main inputs: a collection of items and a name for the resulting DataTable. The collection can be of any type (generic or non-generic), and the name is a string that will be used as the table name.

- Outputs: The output of both methods is a DataTable object, which represents the input collection in a tabular format.

- How it achieves its purpose: The code provides two overloaded methods named ToDataTableBase. The first method is generic and takes a strongly-typed collection, while the second method can handle any type of collection. The generic method simply calls the non-generic method, passing the type of the collection items.

- Logic flow: The non-generic method creates a new DataTable with the given name. It then examines the properties of the type passed to it, excluding properties marked with a DataTableIgnoreAttribute and properties that are themselves collections. For each valid property, it adds a column to the DataTable. Then, it iterates through the input collection, creating a new row for each item and populating it with the values of the item's properties.

The code uses reflection to dynamically inspect the properties of the objects in the collection. This allows it to work with any type of object, without needing to know its structure in advance. It also handles null values and special cases like empty characters, converting them to DBNull.Value to ensure they're properly represented in the DataTable.

In simple terms, this code provides a flexible way to turn lists of objects into table-like structures, which can be useful in many programming scenarios where you need to work with data in a tabular format.
