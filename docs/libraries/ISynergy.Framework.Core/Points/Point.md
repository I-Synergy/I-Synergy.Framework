# Point.cs

This code defines a class called Point that represents a two-dimensional point with X and Y coordinates. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to store and manipulate 2D coordinates in a program.

The Point class doesn't take any direct inputs when it's created, but it has two properties: X and Y, which are both of type double. These properties can be set when a new Point object is created (using a constructor, which is not shown in this snippet) and can be read at any time, but they can't be changed after the object is created (because they have a private set).

The class doesn't produce any outputs on its own, but it provides a structure that can be used in other parts of a program. For example, you could use Point objects to represent locations on a map, positions in a game, or coordinates in a graphing application.

The class achieves its purpose by simply storing the X and Y values and making them accessible through properties. It doesn't contain any complex algorithms in the shown code, but it does implement the IComparable<Point> interface, which suggests that Point objects can be compared to each other (though the comparison logic is not shown in this snippet).

An important aspect of this class is that it's marked as [Serializable], which means it can be easily converted to a format that can be stored or transmitted, and then recreated later.

The code also includes some helpful comments and an example of how to use the Point class. This example shows creating two points, setting their coordinates, and calculating the distance between them (using a DistanceTo method that's not shown in this snippet).

Overall, this Point class provides a simple but useful way to work with 2D coordinates in a program, serving as a building block for more complex operations involving spatial data.
