# DataTableIgnoreAttribute

This code defines a custom attribute called DataTableIgnoreAttribute in the ISynergy.Framework.Core.Attributes namespace. The purpose of this attribute is to provide a way to mark certain properties of a class so that they can be ignored when working with data tables.

The DataTableIgnoreAttribute doesn't take any inputs or produce any outputs directly. Instead, it serves as a marker that can be applied to properties in other classes. When developers use this attribute, they're essentially telling the program, "Don't include this property when you're dealing with data tables."

To achieve its purpose, the attribute is defined as a class that inherits from the built-in Attribute class. This inheritance is what makes it a custom attribute in C#. The class itself is empty, which means it doesn't add any additional functionality beyond being a marker.

The attribute is decorated with the AttributeUsage attribute, which specifies how and where this custom attribute can be used. In this case, it's set to AttributeTargets.Property, meaning it can only be applied to properties of a class. The AllowMultiple = true parameter indicates that this attribute can be applied multiple times to the same property if needed.

While there's no complex logic or data transformation happening within this attribute, its presence or absence on a property can influence how other parts of the program behave when working with data tables. For example, if a program is converting a class to a data table, it might check for this attribute and skip any properties that have it applied.

In summary, the DataTableIgnoreAttribute is a simple yet powerful tool that allows developers to have more control over how their data is handled, particularly when working with data tables. It doesn't do much on its own, but its use can significantly affect how other parts of a program interact with the properties it's applied to.
