# SymbolAttribute.cs

This code defines a custom attribute called SymbolAttribute in C#. Attributes in C# are a way to add metadata or additional information to various elements in your code, such as classes, methods, or properties.

The purpose of this SymbolAttribute is to associate a symbol (represented as a string) with any code element it's applied to. This could be useful for adding symbolic representations or identifiers to different parts of your program.

The attribute takes a single input: a string representing the symbol. This is provided when the attribute is used in other parts of the code. For example, you might use it like this: [Symbol("$")].

The SymbolAttribute doesn't produce any direct output. Instead, it stores the provided symbol as a property that can be accessed later through reflection (a programming technique that allows examination of code structure at runtime).

The code achieves its purpose by defining a class called SymbolAttribute that inherits from the built-in Attribute class. This inheritance is what makes it usable as an attribute in C#. The class has a single property called Symbol, which is used to store the symbol string.

The attribute is designed to be flexible in its usage. The [AttributeUsage] decorator at the top of the class indicates that this attribute can be applied to all types of code elements (classes, methods, properties, etc.) and can be used multiple times on the same element if needed.

The class includes a constructor that takes the symbol string as a parameter and assigns it to the Symbol property. This allows for easy initialization when the attribute is used.

In terms of logic flow, it's quite straightforward. When this attribute is applied to a code element, the provided symbol is stored. Later, when the program needs to retrieve this symbol (likely through reflection), it can access the Symbol property of this attribute.

Overall, this code provides a way to tag various parts of a program with symbolic identifiers, which could be useful for categorization, identification, or other metadata purposes in a larger application.
