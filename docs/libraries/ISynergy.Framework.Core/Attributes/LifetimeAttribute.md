# LifetimeAttribute.cs

This code defines a custom attribute called LifetimeAttribute, which is used to specify the lifetime of a class in a dependency injection system. The purpose of this attribute is to allow developers to easily mark classes with information about how long they should exist within an application.

The attribute takes one input: a value from the Lifetimes enumeration. This enumeration likely contains options such as "Singleton" (where only one instance of the class is created and shared) or "Scoped" (where a new instance is created for each scope, like a web request).

The LifetimeAttribute doesn't produce any direct output. Instead, it serves as metadata that can be read by other parts of the application, typically a dependency injection container. This container would use the information provided by the attribute to determine how to create and manage instances of the marked classes.

The code achieves its purpose by creating a simple class that inherits from the built-in Attribute class. It has a single property called Lifetime, which stores the value passed to the attribute's constructor. This property can later be accessed by reflection to determine the intended lifetime of the class.

The attribute is designed to be used only on classes (AttributeTargets.Class), can't be used multiple times on the same class (AllowMultiple = false), and can be inherited by derived classes (Inherited = true). These rules are defined by the AttributeUsage attribute applied to the LifetimeAttribute class itself.

In practice, a developer would use this attribute by placing it above a class declaration, like this:

[Lifetime(Lifetimes.Singleton)] public class MyService { ... }

This would indicate that MyService should be treated as a singleton in the application's dependency injection system. The system would then ensure that only one instance of MyService is created and used throughout the application's lifetime.

Overall, this code provides a simple but powerful way to configure how classes should be managed in a larger application, making it easier to control the creation and lifespan of objects in a consistent manner.
