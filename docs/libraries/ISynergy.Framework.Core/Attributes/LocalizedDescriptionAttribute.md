# LocalizedDescriptionAttribute

The LocalizedDescriptionAttribute class is a custom attribute in C# that provides a way to add localized descriptions to various elements in your code, such as classes, methods, or properties.

The purpose of this code is to create an attribute that can be used to add descriptions to code elements, where the descriptions are automatically translated into different languages based on the current language settings of the application.

This attribute takes a single input: a string parameter called "resourceKey". This resourceKey is used to look up the appropriate translated description from a language service.

The output of this attribute is a localized description string, which can be accessed through the "Description" property of the attribute.

To achieve its purpose, the attribute uses a service locator pattern to get an instance of an ILanguageService. This service is responsible for translating the resourceKey into the appropriate language. When the attribute is created, it immediately uses this service to translate the resourceKey and stores the result in the Description property.

The important logic flow here is that the translation happens at the time the attribute is created, not when it's used. This means the description is translated once and then stored, rather than being translated every time it's accessed.

This attribute is designed to be used multiple times on the same code element, which allows for descriptions in multiple languages to be added to a single item. This is achieved through the [AttributeUsage] attribute at the top of the class, which specifies that the attribute can be used multiple times.

In simple terms, this code creates a special label (attribute) that you can attach to your code to give it a description. The cool part is that this description can automatically change to different languages depending on what language your program is set to use. It does this by asking a special service to translate the description when the label is first created.
