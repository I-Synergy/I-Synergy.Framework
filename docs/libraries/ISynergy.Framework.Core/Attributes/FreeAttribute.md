# FreeAttribute.cs

This code defines a custom attribute called FreeAttribute, which is used to mark an assembly (a compiled unit of code) as either free to use or not. The purpose of this attribute is to provide a simple way to indicate whether an application or library is free or has some restrictions.

The attribute takes a single input: a boolean value (true or false) that represents whether the application is free. This is passed to the attribute's constructor when it's applied to an assembly.

The attribute doesn't produce any direct output. Instead, it stores the input value in a property called IsFree, which can be read later by other parts of the program that need to know if the application is free.

The code achieves its purpose by creating a class that inherits from the built-in Attribute class. This makes it a custom attribute that can be applied to assemblies. The class has a constructor that takes a boolean parameter and stores it in the IsFree property. This property is marked as "get; private set;", which means other parts of the code can read its value, but only the constructor can set it.

The attribute is marked with [AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Assembly, AllowMultiple = false)], which means it can only be applied to assemblies and can't be used multiple times on the same assembly.

The main logic flow is simple: when the attribute is applied to an assembly, it's instantiated with a boolean value. This value is then stored and can be accessed later to determine if the assembly is marked as free or not.

In summary, this code provides a way to label assemblies as free or not free, which can be useful for licensing or feature-enabling purposes in a larger application. Other parts of the program can check for the presence of this attribute and its value to make decisions based on whether the assembly is marked as free.
