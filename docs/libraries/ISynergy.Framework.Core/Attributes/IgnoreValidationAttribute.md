# IgnoreValidationAttribute.cs

This code defines a custom attribute called IgnoreValidationAttribute in the ISynergy.Framework.Core.Attributes namespace. The purpose of this attribute is to provide a way to mark certain properties in a class so that they can be skipped during validation processes.

The IgnoreValidationAttribute doesn't take any inputs or produce any outputs directly. Instead, it serves as a marker that can be applied to properties in other classes. When a validation system encounters a property decorated with this attribute, it should skip validating that property.

The attribute is created by defining a class that inherits from the Attribute class, which is a built-in class in C# for creating custom attributes. The class itself is empty, meaning it doesn't contain any methods or properties of its own. Its functionality comes from simply existing and being able to be applied to properties.

The AttributeUsage attribute applied to the IgnoreValidationAttribute class specifies how and where this attribute can be used. In this case, it's set to AttributeTargets.Property, which means this attribute can only be applied to properties in a class. The AllowMultiple = true parameter indicates that this attribute can be applied multiple times to the same property if needed.

In practice, a developer would use this attribute by placing [IgnoreValidation] above a property in their code. When a validation system runs, it would check for the presence of this attribute and skip validating any properties that have it.

This attribute is particularly useful in scenarios where you have a class with many properties that typically need validation, but you want to exclude one or more specific properties from that validation process. Instead of modifying the validation logic itself, you can simply mark the properties to be ignored with this attribute, making your code more flexible and easier to maintain.
