# IdentityAttribute.cs

This code defines a custom attribute called IdentityAttribute in C#. Attributes in C# are special tags that can be applied to various elements of code (like classes, methods, or properties) to provide additional information or behavior.

The purpose of this IdentityAttribute is to mark a property as an "identity" property. In programming, an identity property is often used to uniquely identify an object or entity, similar to how a social security number identifies a person.

This attribute doesn't take any inputs directly when it's applied to a property. Instead, it has a single boolean property called IsIdentity, which is set to true by default. This means that when you use this attribute on a property, you're indicating that the property is an identity property.

The attribute doesn't produce any direct outputs. Its main function is to provide metadata (information about data) that can be used by other parts of the program or by tools that analyze the code.

The IdentityAttribute achieves its purpose simply by existing and being applied to properties. When other parts of the program need to know which properties are identity properties, they can check for the presence of this attribute.

The logic in this code is straightforward:

- The attribute is defined as a sealed class, which means no other classes can inherit from it.
- It's marked with [AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Property, AllowMultiple = false)], which specifies that this attribute can only be used on properties and can't be applied multiple times to the same property.
- It has a single boolean property, IsIdentity, which is set to true in the constructor.

In practice, a programmer would use this attribute like this:

public class Person
{
    
    [Identity]

    public int Id { get; set; }

    public string Name { get; set; }
}

This would mark the Id property as an identity property, which could then be used by other parts of the program to understand that this property uniquely identifies a Person object.
