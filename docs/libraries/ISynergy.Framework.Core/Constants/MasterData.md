# MasterData.cs

This code defines a static class called MasterData, which serves as a repository for a list of file types. The purpose of this code is to provide a predefined, read-only collection of FileType objects that represent various file formats commonly used in applications.

The code doesn't take any inputs directly, as it's a static class with a constant collection. It produces a single output: a ReadOnlyCollection of FileType objects, which is stored in the FileTypes property.

The FileTypes collection is created by initializing a List of FileType objects and then converting it to a read-only collection using the AsReadOnly() method. This ensures that the collection cannot be modified after it's created, maintaining data integrity.

Each FileType object in the collection represents a specific file format and contains five pieces of information:

- An ID number
- A human-readable name for the file type
- The file extension (e.g., ".txt", ".doc")
- A boolean indicating whether it's an image file
- The MIME content type associated with the file format

The collection includes various common file types such as text files, Microsoft Word and Excel documents, PDF files, and image formats like JPEG, PNG, GIF, and WebP.

The purpose of this code is to provide a centralized, easily accessible list of file types that can be used throughout an application. This can be helpful for tasks such as file validation, filtering file types in file pickers, or determining how to handle different file formats.

There's a commented-out section that suggests the code might be part of a larger system where file types are filtered based on whether they are images. This filtering logic appears to be platform-dependent, with different approaches for Android and other platforms.

Overall, this code creates a reusable, consistent set of file type definitions that can be referenced anywhere in the application, promoting code organization and reducing redundancy.
