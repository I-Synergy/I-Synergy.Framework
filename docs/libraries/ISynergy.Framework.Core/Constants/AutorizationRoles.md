# AutorizationRoles.cs

This code defines a static class called AutorizationRoles, which serves as a collection of constant string values representing different authorization roles in a system. The purpose of this code is to provide a centralized place to store and access these role names, making it easier to manage and use them throughout the application.

The code doesn't take any inputs or produce any outputs directly. Instead, it acts as a container for predefined string constants that can be used in other parts of the application to check or assign user roles and permissions.

The class defines several constant strings, each representing a specific role or permission:

- admin_view: Represents the role for viewing admin-level information.
- admin_create: Represents the role for creating admin-level resources.
- admin_update: Represents the role for updating admin-level resources.
- admin_delete: Represents the role for deleting admin-level resources.
- user_view: Represents the role for viewing user-level information.

By using these constants, developers can ensure consistency when referring to roles throughout the application. For example, instead of typing "admin_view" as a string every time it's needed, they can use AutorizationRoles.admin_view, which helps prevent typos and makes the code more maintainable.

The class is marked as static, which means you don't need to create an instance of it to use its members. You can directly access these constants using the class name, like AutorizationRoles.admin_view.

There's no complex logic or data transformation happening in this code. It simply defines a set of string constants that can be used elsewhere in the application to manage user roles and permissions more effectively.
