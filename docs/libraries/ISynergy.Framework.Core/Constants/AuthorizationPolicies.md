# AuthorizationPolicies.cs

This code defines a static class called AuthorizationPolicies, which is used to store constant string values representing different authorization policies in an application. The purpose of this code is to provide a centralized place to define and access these policy names, making it easier to manage and use them throughout the application.

The code doesn't take any inputs or produce any outputs directly. Instead, it serves as a container for predefined string constants that can be used in other parts of the application.

There are two authorization policies defined in this class:

- Administrator: Represented by the constant string "Administrator"
- User: Represented by the constant string "User"

These constants can be accessed from other parts of the application by referencing AuthorizationPolicies.Administrator or AuthorizationPolicies.User.

The main purpose of this code is to improve code organization and maintainability. By defining these policy names as constants in a single location, it becomes easier to manage them and reduces the risk of typos or inconsistencies when using these policy names throughout the application.

For example, if a developer needs to check if a user has administrator privileges, they can use AuthorizationPolicies.Administrator instead of typing out the string "Administrator" directly. This approach makes the code more readable and less prone to errors.

While this code may seem simple, it plays an important role in structuring the authorization system of the application. It provides a clear and consistent way to refer to different user roles or access levels, which can be used in conjunction with other parts of the application to control access to various features or resources.
