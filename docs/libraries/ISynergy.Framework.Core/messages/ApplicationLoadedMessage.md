# ApplicationLoadedMessage.cs

This code defines a simple message class called ApplicationLoadedMessage that is used to indicate when an application has finished loading. Let's break down what this code does in simple terms:

- The purpose of this code is to create a specialized message type that can be used within an application to signal that it has completed its loading process. This can be useful for coordinating actions or updates that should occur after the application is fully loaded.

- This class doesn't take any direct inputs. It's a message class, which means it's typically instantiated and used to carry information or trigger events in other parts of the application.

- The class doesn't produce any direct outputs. Instead, it serves as a signal or notification that can be used by other parts of the application to trigger actions or update states.

- The class achieves its purpose by inheriting from a base class called BaseMessage. This inheritance allows ApplicationLoadedMessage to have all the properties and methods of BaseMessage, while also being recognizable as a specific type of message related to application loading.

- There isn't any complex logic or data transformation happening in this code. It's a very simple class definition that creates a new type of message.

The class is defined as sealed, which means that no other classes can inherit from ApplicationLoadedMessage. This ensures that this message type remains specific and can't be further specialized.

In practice, this class would be used by creating an instance of ApplicationLoadedMessage when the application has finished loading, and then sending or broadcasting this message to other parts of the application that need to know when loading is complete. These other parts can then react accordingly, such as displaying the main user interface or starting background processes.
