# BaseMessage Class Explanation:

The BaseMessage class is a foundational component for creating and managing messages in a messaging system. It serves as a base class that other, more specific message types can inherit from and build upon.

The purpose of this code is to provide a common structure for all messages that might be sent through a messaging system. It defines basic properties that all messages should have, such as who sent the message and who it's intended for.

This class doesn't take any direct inputs or produce any outputs on its own. Instead, it's designed to be inherited by other classes that will use its structure and potentially add more specific properties or methods.

The BaseMessage class achieves its purpose by defining three constructors and two properties:

- A default constructor that creates an empty message.
- A constructor that takes a 'sender' parameter, allowing you to specify who sent the message.
- A constructor that takes both a 'sender' and a 'target' parameter, letting you specify both who sent the message and who it's intended for.

The class also defines two properties:

- 'Sender': This holds a reference to the object that sent the message.
- 'Target': This holds a reference to the intended recipient of the message.

The logic flow is straightforward. When you create a new message using one of the constructors, it sets up the message with the provided information. If you use the constructor with both sender and target, it first calls the constructor with just the sender (using ': this(sender)') and then sets the target.

This class doesn't perform any complex data transformations. Its main job is to store and provide access to the sender and target of a message. The properties are set up with public getters but private setters, meaning you can read these values from outside the class, but they can only be set when the message is first created.

By providing this base structure, the BaseMessage class allows developers to create more specific types of messages that all share these common properties, ensuring consistency across different message types in the system.
