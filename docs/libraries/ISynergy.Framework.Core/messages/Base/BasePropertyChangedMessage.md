# BasePropertyChangedMessage Class Explanation:

The BasePropertyChangedMessage class is a foundational component in a messaging system, specifically designed to handle property change notifications. Its main purpose is to provide a base structure for messages that inform about changes in object properties.

This class doesn't take any direct inputs or produce any outputs on its own. Instead, it's meant to be inherited by other classes that will use its structure to create specific property change messages.

The class achieves its purpose by defining a common set of constructors and a property that all property change messages should have. It has two main constructors:

- The first constructor takes a sender (the object that's sending the message) and a propertyName (the name of the property that changed).
- The second constructor adds a target parameter, which can be used to specify an intended recipient for the message.

Both constructors set the PropertyName field, which is a crucial piece of information in property change notifications. This allows the receiver of the message to know which property has been modified.

An important aspect of this class is that it's abstract, meaning it can't be instantiated directly. It's designed to be a base class that other, more specific property change message classes will inherit from. This allows for a common structure across all property change messages while still allowing for type-specific implementations.

The class inherits from BaseMessage, suggesting there's a broader messaging system in place, with BasePropertyChangedMessage being a specialized type of message for property changes.

Overall, this class provides a standardized way to create and structure messages about property changes in a system, which is a common need in many programming scenarios, especially in user interface and data binding contexts.
