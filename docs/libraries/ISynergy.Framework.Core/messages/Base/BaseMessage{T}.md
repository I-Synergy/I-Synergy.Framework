# BaseMessage Class Explanation:

The BaseMessage class is a generic abstract class designed to create a foundation for message objects in a messaging system. Its purpose is to provide a flexible structure for messages that can contain different types of content.

This class takes a generic type parameter T, which represents the type of content the message will hold. It doesn't take any specific inputs or produce any outputs directly, as it's meant to be inherited by other classes that will implement more specific message types.

The class achieves its purpose by providing three different constructors, each allowing for different levels of detail when creating a message:

- The first constructor takes only the content of type T.
- The second constructor takes both a sender (of type object) and the content.
- The third constructor takes a sender, a target (also of type object), and the content.

These constructors allow for flexibility in creating messages with varying amounts of information about the sender and intended recipient.

The class stores the content in a property called Content, which can be accessed but not modified after the message is created. This ensures that the message content remains consistent once it's set.

By inheriting from a base BaseMessage class (not shown in the provided code), this generic version likely adds additional functionality or properties specific to handling generic content.

The main purpose of this class is to serve as a building block for more specific message types in a larger messaging system. It provides a consistent structure for messages, allowing developers to create specialized message classes that can handle different types of content while maintaining a common base structure.
