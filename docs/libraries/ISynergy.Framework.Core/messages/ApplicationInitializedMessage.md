# ApplicationInitializedMessage.cs

This code defines a simple class called ApplicationInitializedMessage that is used to represent a message indicating that an application has been initialized. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to notify other parts of the program that the application's initialization process is complete.

The class doesn't take any specific inputs or produce any outputs on its own. Instead, it serves as a type of message that can be created and passed around within the application to signal that initialization is finished.

The ApplicationInitializedMessage class achieves its purpose by inheriting from a base class called BaseMessage. This means it likely inherits some common properties or behaviors that all messages in the system share. By creating a specific class for the application initialized message, developers can easily identify and handle this particular type of notification in their code.

There isn't any complex logic or data transformation happening within this class. It's a very simple declaration that creates a new type of message. The class is marked as sealed, which means that no other classes can inherit from it. This ensures that the message type remains specific and cannot be extended or modified by other parts of the codebase.

The class is part of the ISynergy.Framework.Core.Messages namespace, which suggests it belongs to a larger framework or system for handling various types of messages within an application. By using this message class, developers can create a clear and type-safe way of communicating that the application has finished its initialization process, which can be useful for triggering subsequent actions or updates in other parts of the program.
