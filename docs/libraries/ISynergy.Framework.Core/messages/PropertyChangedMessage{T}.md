# PropertyChangedMessage Class Explanation:

The PropertyChangedMessage class is a specialized message type designed to communicate changes in property values within a software application. This class is particularly useful in scenarios where one part of the program needs to inform another part about a change in a specific property's value.

The purpose of this code is to create a structured way to package and send information about a property that has changed. It takes three main inputs: the old value of the property, the new value of the property, and the name of the property that changed. Optionally, it can also include information about the sender of the message and its intended target.

This class doesn't produce any direct outputs. Instead, it serves as a container for the change information, which can be used by other parts of the program to react to the property change.

The class achieves its purpose by providing two constructors that allow for flexible creation of PropertyChangedMessage objects. These constructors initialize the message with the necessary information about the property change. The first constructor includes a sender parameter, while the second one doesn't, allowing for different levels of detail in the message creation.

An important aspect of this class is its use of generics (indicated by ). This allows the class to work with properties of any data type, making it very versatile. The old and new values of the changed property are stored as type T, which means they can be integers, strings, custom objects, or any other type depending on how the class is used.

The class inherits from BasePropertyChangedMessage, which likely provides some common functionality for all property change messages. By extending this base class, PropertyChangedMessage can focus on the specific details of storing and providing access to the old and new values of the changed property.

In summary, this code provides a structured way to create messages about property changes, which can be used in a larger system to keep different parts of an application synchronized when data changes occur. It's a building block for creating responsive and interconnected software systems.
