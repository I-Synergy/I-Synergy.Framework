# IResult Interface

This code defines an interface called IResult in the ISynergy.Framework.Core.Abstractions namespace. An interface in C# is like a contract that describes what methods and properties a class should have, without implementing them.

The purpose of this interface is to define a structure for representing the result of an operation that includes some data of a specific type. It's generic, meaning it can work with any data type, which is represented by the T in IResult.

This interface doesn't take any inputs directly, as it's just a definition. It also doesn't produce any outputs on its own. Instead, it declares what should be available in any class that implements this interface.

The interface achieves its purpose by declaring a single property called Data of type T. The 'out' keyword before T indicates that this is a covariant generic type, which means it can be used with derived types of T as well.

The IResult interface inherits from another interface called IResult (without the generic type parameter). This means that any class implementing IResult must also implement whatever is defined in the IResult interface.

In terms of logic flow or data transformation, this interface doesn't perform any operations itself. It's simply a blueprint for classes that will implement it. These implementing classes will provide the actual logic for setting and getting the Data property.

The main idea behind this interface is to create a standardized way of returning results from operations, where the result includes some data of a specific type. This can be useful in scenarios where you want to return not just the data itself, but perhaps additional information about the operation's success or failure, which might be defined in the base IResult interface.
