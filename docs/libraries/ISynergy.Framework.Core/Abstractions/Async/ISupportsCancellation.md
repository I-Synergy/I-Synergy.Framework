# ISupportsCancellation Interface

This code defines an interface called ISupportsCancellation, which is designed to be used by algorithms or operations that can be cancelled while they are running. The purpose of this interface is to provide a standard way for different parts of a program to support cancellation functionality.

The interface doesn't take any direct inputs or produce any outputs. Instead, it defines a property that implementing classes must include. This property is called Token and it's of type CancellationToken. A CancellationToken is a special type in C# that's used to signal when an operation should be cancelled.

The main purpose of this interface is to establish a contract. Any class that implements this interface is promising that it will have a Token property that can be used to cancel its operation. This is useful because it allows other parts of the program to work with cancellable operations in a consistent way, without needing to know the specific details of how each operation works.

For example, imagine you have a long-running task like downloading a large file. If you implement ISupportsCancellation in your download class, you're saying that this download can be cancelled. Other parts of your program can then check for this interface and use the Token property to cancel the download if needed, such as when the user clicks a "Cancel" button.

The interface doesn't contain any logic or algorithms itself. It's simply a blueprint that other classes can follow. When a class implements this interface, it will need to provide its own logic for how to actually respond to cancellation requests using the Token property.

In summary, ISupportsCancellation is a simple but powerful tool that helps create more responsive and user-friendly programs by allowing long-running operations to be cancelled when needed. It does this by providing a standard way for different parts of a program to communicate about cancellation.
