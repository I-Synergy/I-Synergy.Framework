#IModel Interface

This code defines an interface called IModel, which is part of the ISynergy.Framework.Core.Abstractions.Base namespace. An interface in C# is like a contract that specifies what properties and methods a class must implement if it wants to use this interface.

The purpose of this IModel interface is to define a standard structure for model objects in the application. It's designed to represent data entities that can be tracked and audited over time. This interface doesn't contain any implementation details; instead, it outlines the properties that any class implementing this interface must have.

The IModel interface doesn't take any inputs or produce any outputs directly. Instead, it defines a set of properties that classes implementing this interface must include. These properties are:

- Version: An integer that likely represents the version number of the model.
- CreatedDate: A DateTimeOffset that stores when the model was created.
- ChangedDate: A nullable DateTimeOffset that stores when the model was last changed.
- CreatedBy: A string that stores who created the model.
- ChangedBy: A string that stores who last changed the model.

These properties allow for tracking the creation and modification of model objects over time, which can be useful for auditing purposes or maintaining a history of changes.

The interface achieves its purpose by declaring these properties with both getter and setter access (get; set;). This means that any class implementing this interface must provide ways to both read and write these properties.

It's worth noting that IModel inherits from another interface called IObservableClass. This suggests that classes implementing IModel will also need to implement whatever is defined in IObservableClass. The comment also mentions INotifyPropertyChanged, which is typically used for notifying when a property value changes. This implies that objects implementing IModel may be designed to work with data binding scenarios where changes to the object's properties need to be reflected in a user interface.

In summary, the IModel interface provides a standardized way to define model objects with built-in auditing capabilities, allowing applications to track when and by whom these models are created and modified.
