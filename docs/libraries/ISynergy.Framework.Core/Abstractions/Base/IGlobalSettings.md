# IGlobalSettings Interface Explanation:

The IGlobalSettings interface is a simple blueprint for managing global settings in an application. It's designed to provide a consistent way to access and modify two specific settings that might be important across different parts of a program.

This interface doesn't take any inputs or produce any outputs directly. Instead, it defines two properties that can be read from and written to:

- IsFirstRun: This is a boolean (true/false) property that likely indicates whether the application is being run for the first time. This could be useful for tasks like showing a welcome screen or performing initial setup operations.

- Decimals: This is an integer property that probably determines how many decimal places should be used when dealing with numerical values in the application. This could be important for consistency in displaying or calculating numbers throughout the program.

The purpose of this interface is to create a contract that any class implementing IGlobalSettings must follow. By using an interface, the code allows for flexibility in how these settings are actually stored or managed, while ensuring that any part of the application that needs these settings can access them in a consistent way.

There's no complex logic or data transformation happening within this interface. It simply defines the structure that must be adhered to. The actual implementation of how these properties are stored and retrieved would be done in a class that implements this interface.

For a beginner programmer, you can think of this interface as a promise. Any class that says it implements IGlobalSettings is promising to provide a way to check and change whether it's the first run of the application, and to get or set the number of decimal places to use. This allows other parts of the program to work with these settings without needing to know the exact details of how they're managed.
