# IProperty Interface Explanation:

The IProperty interface, defined in the file IPropertyT.cs, is a generic interface that extends another interface called IProperty. This interface is designed to represent a property with a specific type T, which can be any data type (like int, string, or a custom class).

The purpose of this interface is to define a contract for classes that need to manage properties with both current and original values. It doesn't take any inputs or produce any outputs directly, as it's just a definition of what methods and properties implementing classes should have.

This interface declares two properties:

- OriginalValue: This property is of type T and represents the initial or original value of the property. It has both a getter and a setter, meaning you can read and write this value.

- Value: Also of type T, this property represents the current value of the property. Like OriginalValue, it also has both a getter and a setter.

The interface doesn't specify how these properties should be implemented or used; it only defines that they must exist in any class that implements this interface. The actual implementation and usage would be determined by the classes that use this interface.

The main purpose of having both an OriginalValue and a Value is to allow tracking of changes. For example, in a data entry form, you might want to know both the original value of a field and its current value to determine if it has been changed by the user.

While this interface doesn't contain any complex logic or algorithms, it sets up a structure that can be used to build more complex systems for managing and tracking property values. It's a building block that other parts of the program can use to ensure consistent handling of properties across different classes or components.
