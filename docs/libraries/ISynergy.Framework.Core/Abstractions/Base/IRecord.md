# IRecord Interface

This code defines an interface called IRecord in the ISynergy.Framework.Core.Abstractions.Base namespace. An interface in C# is like a contract that describes a set of properties or methods that a class must implement if it wants to use this interface.

The purpose of the IRecord interface is to define a common structure for objects that need to keep track of basic record-keeping information. This interface doesn't contain any actual implementation; it just outlines what properties a class using this interface should have.

The IRecord interface doesn't take any inputs or produce any outputs directly. Instead, it defines six properties that any class implementing this interface must include:

- Version: An integer that likely represents the version number of the record.
- Memo: A string that can store additional notes or information about the record.
- CreatedDate: A DateTimeOffset that stores when the record was created.
- ChangedDate: A nullable DateTimeOffset that stores when the record was last changed (if it has been changed).
- CreatedBy: A string that stores who created the record.
- ChangedBy: A string that stores who last changed the record.

These properties allow for tracking the creation and modification of records, which can be useful for auditing or historical purposes. For example, you can know when a record was created, who created it, if it has been changed, when it was changed, and who changed it.

The interface achieves its purpose by providing a standardized way to include this record-keeping information in any class that needs it. By implementing this interface, a class agrees to provide getters and setters for all these properties, ensuring that this basic information is always available for records of that type.

There's no complex logic or data transformation happening in this interface, as interfaces in C# are just declarations. The actual implementation of how these properties are set and retrieved would be done in the classes that implement this interface.

This kind of interface is commonly used in systems where tracking changes and maintaining a history of records is important, such as in database applications, content management systems, or any application where data integrity and audit trails are crucial.
