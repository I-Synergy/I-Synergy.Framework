# IBindable Interface Explanation

The IBindable interface, defined in the file src\ISynergy.Framework.Core\Abstractions\Base\IBindable.cs, is a simple but important piece of code that helps in creating objects that can notify other parts of a program when their properties change. This is particularly useful in user interface programming, where you want the display to update automatically when data changes.

The purpose of this code is to define a contract (interface) that other classes can implement to gain the ability to notify about property changes. It doesn't contain any implementation details itself, but rather specifies what methods a class must have if it wants to be "bindable."

This interface doesn't take any inputs directly, as it's not a method or function. Instead, it defines what inputs the OnPropertyChanged method should accept when implemented in a class. The OnPropertyChanged method takes one optional parameter: the name of the property that has changed.

In terms of outputs, the IBindable interface doesn't produce any direct outputs. However, when implemented in a class, it allows that class to send notifications (events) when a property changes. These notifications can then be picked up by other parts of the program that need to react to these changes.

The interface achieves its purpose by extending the INotifyPropertyChanged interface (which is part of the .NET framework) and adding an OnPropertyChanged method. This method is meant to be called whenever a property in the implementing class changes its value.

The important logic flow here is that when a property in a class implementing IBindable changes, the class should call the OnPropertyChanged method, passing the name of the changed property. This triggers an event that other parts of the program can listen for and react to.

One interesting feature is the use of the [CallerMemberName] attribute on the propertyName parameter. This allows the method to automatically get the name of the property that called it, making it easier and less error-prone to use.

In summary, the IBindable interface provides a standardized way for objects to communicate changes in their properties, which is crucial for creating responsive and data-driven applications.
