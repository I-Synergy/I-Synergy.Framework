# ITenantEntity.cs

This code defines an interface called ITenantEntity, which is a blueprint for creating entities that belong to a specific tenant in a multi-tenant system. Let's break down what this means and why it's useful:

- The purpose of this code is to establish a common structure for entities that need to be associated with a tenant. In software systems where multiple clients or organizations (tenants) share the same application, it's crucial to keep their data separate. This interface helps achieve that separation.

- This interface doesn't take any inputs directly. Instead, it defines a property that implementing classes must include.

- The output of this interface is a contract that other parts of the program can rely on. Any class that implements ITenantEntity will have a TenantId property.

- The interface achieves its purpose by declaring a single property: TenantId. This property is of type Guid (Globally Unique Identifier), which is perfect for uniquely identifying tenants in a system. By including this property, any entity implementing this interface can be easily associated with a specific tenant.

- While there's no complex logic or data transformation happening in this interface, it's setting up an important relationship. The interface inherits from IEntity, which likely defines common properties for all entities in the system. By extending IEntity, ITenantEntity ensures that tenant-specific entities will have both the general entity properties and the tenant-specific identifier.

In simpler terms, think of this interface as a label that says "I belong to a specific tenant." Any class that implements this interface is promising to include information about which tenant it belongs to. This is incredibly useful in systems where you need to keep different clients' data separate, as you can always check the TenantId to ensure you're working with the correct data for the right tenant.
