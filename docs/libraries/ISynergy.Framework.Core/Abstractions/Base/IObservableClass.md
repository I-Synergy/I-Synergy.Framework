# IObservableClass Interface

The IObservableClass interface, defined in the file src\ISynergy.Framework.Core\Abstractions\Base\IObservableClass.cs, is a blueprint for creating observable classes in C#. This interface is designed to help create objects that can be easily monitored for changes, validated, and integrated into data binding scenarios.

The purpose of this interface is to define a set of properties and methods that any class implementing it should have. These features allow the class to be observed for changes, report errors, and manage its state. This is particularly useful in applications where you need to track changes to data, validate user input, or update user interfaces automatically when data changes.

While this interface doesn't take direct inputs or produce outputs, it defines methods and properties that classes implementing it will use to handle data and state changes. For example, the Validate method would be used to check if the object's data is valid, while the Revert method would be used to undo changes.

The interface achieves its purpose by combining several other interfaces (IBindable, IDisposable, IDataErrorInfo, INotifyDataErrorInfo) and adding its own set of methods and properties. This creates a comprehensive set of tools for managing observable objects.

Some important features of this interface include:

- Error handling: The Errors property and AddValidationError method allow for tracking and managing validation errors.
- State management: The IsDirty and IsValid properties help track whether the object has unsaved changes or is in a valid state.
- Validation: The Validate method and Validator property provide ways to check the object's data validity.
- Property management: The Properties dictionary allows for tracking individual properties of the object.

By implementing this interface, a class would gain the ability to notify observers when its data changes, manage its own state (clean/dirty, valid/invalid), and handle validation errors. This is particularly useful in scenarios like form handling in user interfaces, where you need to track user input, validate it, and respond to changes in real-time.
