# IEntity Interface Explanation:

The IEntity interface, defined in the file src\ISynergy.Framework.Core\Abstractions\Base\IEntity.cs, serves as a blueprint for creating entity objects in the ISynergy Framework. This interface is designed to provide a common structure for entities, which are typically used to represent data objects in an application.

The purpose of this code is to define a set of properties that any class implementing the IEntity interface must include. These properties represent common attributes that most entities in a system might have, such as creation and modification information.

This interface doesn't take any inputs or produce any outputs directly. Instead, it defines a contract that classes implementing this interface must follow. When a class implements IEntity, it agrees to provide implementations for all the properties defined in the interface.

The IEntity interface achieves its purpose by declaring five properties:

- Memo: A string property to store any additional notes or comments about the entity.
- CreatedDate: A DateTimeOffset property to record when the entity was created.
- ChangedDate: A nullable DateTimeOffset property to record when the entity was last modified.
- CreatedBy: A string property to store the identifier of who created the entity.
- ChangedBy: A string property to store the identifier of who last modified the entity.

These properties allow for tracking the creation and modification history of an entity, which is often crucial in many applications for auditing and data management purposes.

It's worth noting that IEntity inherits from another interface called IClass. This means that any class implementing IEntity will also need to implement whatever properties or methods are defined in IClass.

By using this interface, developers can ensure consistency across different entity classes in their application. It provides a standard set of properties that can be useful for tracking and managing entity objects, regardless of their specific purpose or additional properties they might have.
