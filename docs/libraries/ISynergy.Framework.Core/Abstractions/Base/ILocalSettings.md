# ILocalSettings.cs

The code being explained is ILocalSettings.cs, which is an interface definition for local application settings.

This interface defines a set of properties that represent various settings for an application. Its purpose is to provide a standard structure for storing and accessing local settings that can be used across different parts of an application.

The ILocalSettings interface doesn't take any inputs or produce any outputs directly. Instead, it defines a contract that any class implementing this interface must follow. This means that any class that implements ILocalSettings will need to provide getter and setter methods for each of the properties defined in the interface.

The properties defined in this interface cover a range of application settings:

- Language: This represents the default language used in the application.
- IsFullscreen: A boolean value indicating whether the application is in fullscreen mode.
- DefaultUser: Stores the username of the last successfully logged-in user.
- RefreshToken: Stores the refresh token received during authentication.
- Color: Represents the theme color of the application.
- Theme: Specifies the overall theme of the application.
- IsAutoLogin: A boolean indicating whether automatic login is enabled.
- IsAdvanced: A boolean indicating whether the application is in advanced mode.
- MigrationVersion: An integer representing the last used migration version of the application.

The purpose of this interface is to provide a consistent way to access and modify these settings throughout the application. By defining these properties in an interface, the code ensures that any class implementing ILocalSettings will have methods to get and set these values. This allows for flexibility in how these settings are actually stored (e.g., in a file, database, or memory) while maintaining a consistent way to interact with them.

It's important to note that this interface doesn't implement any logic or algorithms itself. It simply defines the structure that implementations of local settings should follow. The actual storage, retrieval, and manipulation of these settings would be handled by classes that implement this interface.
