# IClass

The code being explained is the IClass interface, located in the file src\ISynergy.Framework.Core\Abstractions\Base\IClass.cs.

This code defines an interface called IClass, which serves as a blueprint for classes that will implement it. An interface in programming is like a contract that specifies what properties or methods a class should have, without providing the actual implementation.

The purpose of this interface is to establish a common structure for classes that need to keep track of versioning and deletion status. It doesn't take any inputs or produce any outputs directly, as it's just a definition of what implementing classes should include.

The IClass interface defines two properties:

- Version: This is an integer property that represents the version number of an object. It allows both reading (get) and writing (set) of the version.

- IsDeleted: This is a boolean property that indicates whether an object has been marked as deleted. It also allows both reading and writing of this status.

By defining these properties in an interface, the code ensures that any class implementing IClass will have a way to manage versioning and track whether an object has been deleted. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to maintain different versions of objects or implement soft delete functionality (where objects are marked as deleted but not actually removed from the system).

The interface doesn't specify how these properties should be implemented or used; it simply declares that they must exist in any class that implements this interface. This allows for flexibility in how different classes might handle versioning or deletion, while ensuring a consistent structure across all implementing classes.

In summary, this code provides a simple but important foundation for object management within the system, focusing on versioning and deletion status tracking. It's a building block that other parts of the system can use to create more complex functionality around object lifecycle management.
