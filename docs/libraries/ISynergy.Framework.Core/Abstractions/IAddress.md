# IAddress Interface

The IAddress interface, defined in the ISynergy.Framework.Core.Abstractions namespace, serves as a blueprint for representing address information in a structured manner. This interface is designed to standardize how address data is handled across different parts of a software application.

The purpose of this code is to define a contract that any class implementing the IAddress interface must follow. It doesn't contain any implementation details itself but rather specifies what properties an address should have.

This interface doesn't take any inputs or produce any outputs directly. Instead, it defines a set of properties that classes implementing this interface must include. These properties represent different components of an address, such as street name, house number, zip code, and city.

The IAddress interface achieves its purpose by declaring several properties, each representing a specific piece of address information. These properties include:

- Street: A string to store the name of the street.
- ExtraAddressLine: A string for any additional address information.
- HouseNumber: An integer to store the house number.
- Addition: A string for any additional information related to the house number.
- Zipcode: A string to store the postal code.

Each property in the interface is defined with a getter and setter (get; set;), which means that classes implementing this interface must provide ways to both read and write these values.

By defining this interface, the code ensures that any class representing an address in the system will have a consistent structure. This standardization makes it easier to work with address data across different parts of the application, as developers can rely on these properties being available for any object that implements the IAddress interface.

It's important to note that this code snippet only shows part of the interface. There may be additional properties defined in the full interface that are not visible in this excerpt.
