# IResult Interface

This code defines an interface called IResult in the ISynergy.Framework.Core.Abstractions namespace. An interface in C# is like a contract that describes what properties or methods a class should have, without implementing the actual functionality.

The purpose of this interface is to provide a standardized structure for representing the result of an operation or process. It's designed to be simple and easy to understand, even for beginners.

The IResult interface doesn't take any inputs directly, as it's not a method or function. Instead, it defines two properties that any class implementing this interface must include:

- Messages: This is a List of strings, which can be used to store any messages or information related to the result. For example, it could contain error messages, warnings, or success notifications.

- Succeeded: This is a boolean (true/false) value that indicates whether the operation was successful or not.

The interface doesn't produce any outputs on its own. It's meant to be implemented by other classes, which will then provide the actual functionality for setting and getting these properties.

The main purpose of this interface is to create a consistent way of reporting results across different parts of an application. By using this interface, developers can ensure that all result objects have the same basic structure, making it easier to handle and process results in a uniform manner.

For example, a class implementing this interface might use it like this:

- Set Succeeded to true if an operation completes without errors, or false if there were problems.
- Add informational or error messages to the Messages list as needed.

This interface doesn't include any complex logic or data transformations. Its simplicity is intentional, allowing it to be versatile and applicable in many different scenarios where you need to report the outcome of an operation along with any relevant messages.
