# UnexpectedEnumValueException

This code defines a custom exception class called UnexpectedEnumValueException, which is designed to be used when an unexpected value of an enumeration (enum) is encountered in a program. Enums are a special type in programming that represent a set of named constants.

The purpose of this exception class is to provide a specific way to handle errors related to unexpected enum values. It allows programmers to throw this exception when they encounter an enum value that they didn't anticipate or that shouldn't occur in their program logic.

This class doesn't take any inputs or produce any outputs directly. Instead, it's used to create exception objects that can be thrown and caught in other parts of the program. When an UnexpectedEnumValueException is thrown, it carries information about the error that occurred.

The class achieves its purpose by extending the built-in Exception class, which is the base class for all exceptions in C#. It provides three different constructors (ways to create the exception):

- A parameterless constructor that creates a basic exception with no additional information.
- A constructor that takes a string message, allowing the programmer to provide a custom error message.
- A constructor that takes both a message and an inner exception, which is useful for wrapping other exceptions that might have caused this one.

Each of these constructors calls the corresponding constructor of the base Exception class using the "base" keyword, ensuring that the UnexpectedEnumValueException behaves like a standard exception.

The [Serializable] attribute at the beginning of the class definition allows this exception to be serialized (converted to a format that can be easily stored or transmitted) if needed.

While there's no complex logic or data transformation happening in this code, it's an important building block for error handling in larger programs. By using this custom exception, programmers can write more specific error-handling code, making their programs more robust and easier to debug when unexpected enum values occur.
