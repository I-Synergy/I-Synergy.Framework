# InvalidClaimValueException

This code defines a custom exception class called InvalidClaimValueException, which is used in the ISynergy.Framework.Core.Exceptions namespace. The purpose of this class is to create a specific type of exception that can be thrown when a claim (a piece of information about a user) is found but has an invalid value.

The InvalidClaimValueException class inherits from another exception class called ClaimAuthorizationException. This means it has all the features of ClaimAuthorizationException but adds some specific functionality for invalid claim values.

The class provides three different constructors (ways to create an instance of the exception):

- The first constructor takes a string parameter called claimType. When used, it creates an exception with a message that says the claim of the specified type was found but has an invalid value.

- The second constructor doesn't take any parameters. This allows creating an exception without specifying any additional information.

- The third constructor takes two parameters: a message string and an innerException. This is useful when you want to provide a custom error message and include information about another exception that might have caused this one.

In terms of inputs and outputs, this class doesn't process data in the traditional sense. Instead, it's used to create exception objects that can be thrown in other parts of the program when an invalid claim value is encountered. The input would be the information provided when creating the exception (like the claim type or a custom message), and the output would be the exception object itself.

The main purpose of this class is to provide a way for other parts of the program to signal that a specific type of error has occurred - namely, that a claim was found but its value was invalid. This allows the program to handle this specific situation differently from other types of errors if needed.

The logic is straightforward: when an instance of this exception is created, it stores the provided information (like the claim type or custom message) so that it can be accessed later when the exception is caught and handled elsewhere in the program.

Overall, this class is a tool for error handling in a program that deals with claims, allowing developers to specifically identify and handle situations where a claim's value is invalid.
