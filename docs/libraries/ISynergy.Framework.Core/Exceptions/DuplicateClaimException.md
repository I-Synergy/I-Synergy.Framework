# DuplicateClaimException

This code defines a custom exception class called DuplicateClaimException, which is used to handle errors related to duplicate claims in an authorization system. The purpose of this class is to provide a specific type of exception that can be thrown when a claim (a piece of information about a user) is found multiple times in a system where it should only appear once.

The DuplicateClaimException class doesn't take any inputs or produce any outputs directly. Instead, it's designed to be instantiated and thrown when an error condition is detected elsewhere in the program.

The class achieves its purpose by extending the ClaimAuthorizationException class, which likely handles general claim-related authorization errors. By creating a more specific exception type, developers can catch and handle this particular error scenario separately from other authorization issues.

The class provides three different constructors, which are ways to create a new instance of the exception:

- The first constructor takes a string parameter called claimType. It creates an exception with a custom error message that includes the type of claim that was found multiple times.

- The second constructor doesn't take any parameters. This allows creating an exception without specifying any additional information.

- The third constructor takes two parameters: a custom error message and an inner exception. This is useful for providing more detailed error information or wrapping another exception that might have caused this one.

The main logic in this class is quite simple. When an instance of DuplicateClaimException is created using the first constructor, it automatically generates an error message explaining that a specific claim type was found multiple times when it should only appear once. This message is then passed to the base class constructor, which handles the rest of the exception creation process.

By using this custom exception class, developers can easily identify and handle situations where duplicate claims are causing problems in their authorization system. They can catch this specific exception type and take appropriate actions, such as logging the error, notifying the user, or attempting to resolve the duplication.
