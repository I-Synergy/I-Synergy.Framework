# ClaimNotFoundException.cs

This code defines a custom exception class called ClaimNotFoundException in the ISynergy.Framework.Core.Exceptions namespace. The purpose of this class is to create a specific type of exception that can be thrown when a claim (a piece of information about a user) is not found during an authorization process.

The ClaimNotFoundException class inherits from another custom exception class called ClaimAuthorizationException. This means it has all the features of its parent class, plus any additional functionality defined within it.

This class doesn't take any inputs or produce any outputs directly. Instead, it's designed to be used by other parts of the program when they need to signal that a specific claim is missing.

The class provides three different constructors (ways to create an instance of the class):

- A default constructor that doesn't take any parameters. This can be used to create a basic instance of the exception without any specific message.

- A constructor that takes a string parameter called claimType. This is used to create an exception with a custom message that includes the type of claim that wasn't found. For example, if you try to find a claim called "Role" and it's not there, you could create the exception like this: new ClaimNotFoundException("Role"). The resulting error message would be "Claim 'Role' not found."

- A constructor that takes two parameters: a string message and an Exception called innerException. This is useful for creating more detailed exception information, especially when one exception is caused by another.

The main logic in this class is quite simple. It's primarily about providing different ways to create and customize the exception. The most interesting part is in the second constructor, where it automatically formats a helpful error message using the provided claim type.

In practice, this exception class would be used in parts of the program that deal with user authorization. If the program is checking for a specific claim (like a user role or permission) and can't find it, it could throw this exception. This allows other parts of the program to catch and handle this specific type of error, potentially providing more helpful feedback to users or administrators about what went wrong during the authorization process.
