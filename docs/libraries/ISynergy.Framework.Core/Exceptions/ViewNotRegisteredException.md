# ViewNotRegisteredException.cs

This code defines a custom exception class called ViewNotRegisteredException. In simple terms, an exception is a way to handle errors or unexpected situations in a program. This particular exception is designed to be used when a view (likely referring to a user interface component) hasn't been properly registered in the system.

The purpose of this code is to create a specialized type of error that can be thrown and caught in other parts of the program when a specific problem occurs - namely, when a view is not registered as expected.

This exception class doesn't take any specific inputs on its own. However, when it's used in other parts of the program, it can be created with two optional pieces of information:

- A message explaining the error (as a string)
- Another exception that might have caused this error (called an inner exception)

The class doesn't produce any outputs directly. Instead, it's meant to be used as a signal in the program to indicate that something went wrong, specifically that a view wasn't registered properly.

The ViewNotRegisteredException achieves its purpose by inheriting from the standard Exception class. This means it has all the basic features of a normal exception, but it can be recognized as a specific type of error related to unregistered views.

The class has a constructor (a special method that creates new instances of the class) which can accept a message and an inner exception. These are passed to the base Exception class using the ": base(message, innerException)" syntax. This allows the ViewNotRegisteredException to carry additional information about what went wrong.

The [Serializable] attribute at the top of the class definition is a special marker that allows this exception to be converted into a format that can be saved or sent between different parts of a program or even between different computers.

In summary, this code creates a custom error type that can be used throughout a program to signal when a view hasn't been registered properly, allowing for more specific error handling related to this particular problem.
