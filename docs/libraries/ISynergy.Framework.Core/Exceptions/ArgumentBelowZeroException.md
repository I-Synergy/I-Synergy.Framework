# ArgumentBelowZeroException

This code defines a custom exception class called ArgumentBelowZeroException. The purpose of this class is to create a specific type of error that can be used when a program encounters an argument (input value) that is below zero when it shouldn't be.

The ArgumentBelowZeroException is a specialized version of the ArgumentOutOfRangeException. It doesn't take any unique inputs or produce any outputs on its own. Instead, it's designed to be thrown (raised) by other parts of a program when they detect an invalid argument.

The class achieves its purpose by providing several constructors (different ways to create the exception) that allow programmers to include various details about the error when it occurs. These constructors take inputs such as the name of the parameter that caused the error, the actual value that was provided, or another exception that might have led to this one.

The main logic of this class is quite simple. It sets up a standard error message ("Argument should be bigger than 0.") and then provides different ways to create the exception with this message, along with any additional information that might be helpful for debugging.

One important aspect of this class is that it's marked as [Serializable]. This means that the exception can be converted into a format that can be easily saved or sent between different parts of a program, which can be useful for logging errors or sending error reports.

In summary, the ArgumentBelowZeroException is a tool for programmers to use when they want to clearly indicate that a specific type of error has occurred - namely, that an argument was provided that was less than zero when it should have been zero or greater. This helps make error handling more precise and can make debugging easier.
