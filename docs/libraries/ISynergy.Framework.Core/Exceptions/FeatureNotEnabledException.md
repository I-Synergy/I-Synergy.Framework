# FeatureNotEnabledException

This code defines a custom exception class called FeatureNotEnabledException. The purpose of this class is to create a specific type of exception that can be used when a feature in a software application is not enabled or available.

The FeatureNotEnabledException class doesn't take any inputs directly, but it provides three different constructors (ways to create the exception) that allow developers to customize the exception message and include additional information when needed.

As for outputs, this class doesn't produce any direct outputs. Instead, it's used to throw an exception, which interrupts the normal flow of a program when a feature is not enabled.

The class achieves its purpose by inheriting from the standard Exception class in C#. This means it has all the basic functionality of a regular exception, but with a specific name that indicates the nature of the problem (a feature not being enabled).

The class provides three constructors:

- A parameterless constructor that creates a basic FeatureNotEnabledException with no custom message.
- A constructor that takes a string message, allowing developers to provide a custom description of the error.
- A constructor that takes both a message and an inner exception, which is useful for wrapping other exceptions that might have caused the feature to be unavailable.

There isn't any complex logic or data transformation happening in this class. Its main purpose is to provide a way to create and throw a specific type of exception when needed.

In practice, a developer would use this exception when they detect that a certain feature is not enabled in their application. For example, if a user tries to access a premium feature in a free version of an app, the code might throw a FeatureNotEnabledException to indicate that the feature is not available.

This class is part of a larger framework (ISynergy.Framework.Core) and is likely used across different parts of an application to handle situations where features are not enabled or available, providing a consistent way to deal with such scenarios.
