# EntityNotFoundException

This code defines a custom exception class called EntityNotFoundException, which is designed to be used when an entity (like a database record or an object) is not found in a system.

The purpose of this code is to create a specific type of exception that can be thrown and caught in other parts of the program when an entity is not found. This allows developers to handle these situations in a more targeted way, rather than using a generic exception.

The EntityNotFoundException class doesn't take any inputs directly, but it provides three different constructors (ways to create the exception) that allow developers to provide different levels of information when creating the exception:

- A basic constructor with no parameters, which creates a default exception.
- A constructor that takes a string message, allowing developers to provide a custom error message.
- A constructor that takes both a message and an inner exception, which is useful for wrapping other exceptions that might have caused this one.

The output of this code is the ability to create and throw EntityNotFoundException objects in other parts of the program. When thrown, these exceptions can be caught and handled, potentially displaying the error message to users or logging it for developers.

The code achieves its purpose by inheriting from the built-in Exception class, which means it has all the standard features of exceptions in C#. It then adds its own constructors to allow for different ways of creating the exception.

There isn't much complex logic or data transformation happening in this code. Its main function is to serve as a template for creating exceptions. The [Serializable] attribute at the beginning allows the exception to be serialized, which can be useful when the exception needs to be passed between different parts of a distributed system.

In summary, this code provides a way for programmers to create and use a specific type of exception for when entities are not found, allowing for more precise error handling in their applications.
