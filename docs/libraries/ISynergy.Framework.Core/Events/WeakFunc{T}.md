# WeakFunc Class Explanation:

The WeakFunc class is a utility designed to hold and manage weak references to functions (methods) that return a result of type TResult. The purpose of this class is to allow the creation of function references that don't prevent garbage collection of the objects they belong to, which can be useful in preventing memory leaks in certain scenarios.

This class doesn't take any direct inputs when instantiated, but it's generic, meaning it's designed to work with functions that return a specific type (TResult). The main output it produces is the ability to execute the stored function and retrieve its result of type TResult.

The class achieves its purpose by storing references to methods in a way that allows the garbage collector to clean up the objects these methods belong to if they're no longer needed elsewhere in the program. It does this through the use of weak references and reflection.

The class contains several important properties:

- _staticFunc: This private field holds a reference to a static function if one is assigned.
- Method: This protected property stores information about the method using reflection.
- IsStatic: This public property indicates whether the stored function is static or not.

The IsStatic property is particularly interesting as it demonstrates a key piece of logic. It checks if _staticFunc is not null, which indicates whether a static function has been assigned to this WeakFunc instance.

While the shared code doesn't show the full implementation, it sets up the structure for a class that can hold both static and instance methods, with the ability to execute them later while allowing for proper garbage collection. This can be particularly useful in event-driven programming or in scenarios where you need to store function references without creating strong references that might prevent objects from being cleaned up by the garbage collector.
