# WeakEventListener Class Explanation

The WeakEventListener class is a specialized tool designed to help manage event subscriptions in a way that prevents memory leaks. Its main purpose is to allow objects that subscribe to events to be garbage collected when they're no longer needed, even if they still have active event subscriptions.

This class takes three type parameters: TInstance (the type of the object listening for the event), TSource (the type of the object that raises the event), and TEventArgs (the type of the event arguments). It doesn't directly take any inputs or produce any outputs. Instead, it acts as a mediator between the event source and the event listener.

The class achieves its purpose by using a WeakReference to store the instance of the object listening for the event. A WeakReference allows the garbage collector to collect the object if there are no other strong references to it, even if it's still subscribed to an event.

When you create a new WeakEventListener, you pass in the instance of the object that wants to listen to the event. The constructor stores this instance as a WeakReference. This is the key to allowing the listener object to be garbage collected if it's no longer needed.

The class provides two important properties:

- OnEventAction: This is where you set the method that should be called when the event occurs.
- OnDetachAction: This is where you set the method that should be called to unsubscribe from the event.

The main logic of this class is in the OnEvent method. When an event occurs, this method is called. It first tries to get the target object from the WeakReference. If the object still exists, it calls the OnEventAction method to handle the event. If the object no longer exists (has been garbage collected), it calls the Detach method to unsubscribe from the event.

This approach allows for automatic cleanup of event subscriptions when objects are no longer needed, helping to prevent memory leaks that can occur when objects are kept alive solely by event subscriptions.

In summary, the WeakEventListener class provides a way to subscribe to events without preventing the subscribing object from being garbage collected, automatically cleaning up the subscription when the object is no longer needed.
