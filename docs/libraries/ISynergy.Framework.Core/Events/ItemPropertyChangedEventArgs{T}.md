# ItemPropertyChangedEventArgs Class Explanation:

This code defines a class called ItemPropertyChangedEventArgs, which is designed to handle events related to property changes in items of a generic type T. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to pass information about a changed property of an item when an event is triggered.

The class takes two inputs when it's created: an item of type T and a string representing the name of the property that has changed. These inputs are provided through the constructor of the class.

As for outputs, this class doesn't directly produce any outputs. Instead, it stores the input information and makes it available for other parts of the program to access when needed.

The class achieves its purpose by creating two properties: Item and PropertyName. The Item property holds the object of type T that has been changed, while the PropertyName property holds the name of the specific property that was modified.

The logic flow is straightforward. When an instance of this class is created, the constructor takes the item and property name as parameters and assigns them to the respective properties. These properties are then available for reading but cannot be modified from outside the class (they are marked as private set).

This class is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to notify other parts of your program that a specific property of an object has changed. By creating an instance of ItemPropertyChangedEventArgs with the changed item and property name, you can pass this information to event handlers or other parts of your code that need to react to these changes.

In summary, the ItemPropertyChangedEventArgs class serves as a container for information about property changes in objects, allowing for efficient communication of these changes throughout a program.
