# WeakAction Class Explanation:

The WeakAction class is designed to handle actions (functions that don't return a value) in a way that prevents memory leaks in certain programming scenarios. It's particularly useful when dealing with event handlers or callbacks that might outlive the objects they're attached to.

The class doesn't take any direct inputs when it's created, but it's set up to store information about an action that can be executed later. It doesn't produce any direct outputs, but it provides methods to execute the stored action and retrieve information about it.

The main purpose of this class is to hold a reference to an action without preventing the object that owns the action from being garbage collected (cleaned up by the system when it's no longer needed). This is achieved by using "weak references," which allow the system to collect the object if it's no longer being used elsewhere in the program.

The class has a few important properties:

- _staticAction: This holds a reference to a static action (a function that doesn't belong to any specific object instance).
- Method: This stores information about the method that the action will execute.
- MethodName: This property returns the name of the method that the action will execute.

The MethodName property is particularly interesting. It checks if there's a static action stored. If there is, it returns the name of that static action's method. If not, it returns the name of the non-static method that was stored.

This code sets up the basic structure and properties of the WeakAction class. It doesn't show how actions are actually executed or how the weak references are managed, but it lays the groundwork for these operations. The full implementation would include methods to set the action, execute it, and manage the weak references to prevent memory leaks.
