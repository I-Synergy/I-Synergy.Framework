# ReturnEventArgs.cs

This code defines a generic class called ReturnEventArgs<T> which is designed to be used in event-driven programming scenarios where you need to return a value of a specific type along with an event.

The purpose of this class is to provide a way to encapsulate a value of any type (represented by the generic type parameter T) within an event argument. This is useful when you want to pass data back from an event handler to the code that raised the event.

The class takes a single input through its constructor: a value of type T. This value is then stored in a public property called Value, which can be accessed by any code that receives an instance of this class.

The output of this class is essentially the stored value, which can be retrieved through the Value property. The class doesn't produce any other outputs or perform any complex operations.

The logic of this class is quite simple. When an instance of ReturnEventArgs<T> is created, the constructor takes the provided value and assigns it to the Value property. This property is defined as a get-only property, which means its value can be read but not changed after the object is created.

There aren't any complex logic flows or data transformations happening in this class. Its main purpose is to act as a container for a value that needs to be associated with an event.

The class inherits from the standard EventArgs class, which is commonly used in .NET event patterns. This inheritance allows ReturnEventArgs<T> to be used in place of EventArgs in event handlers, while also providing the additional functionality of carrying a typed value.

In practical use, this class would typically be instantiated when raising an event, passing along some data that the event handlers might need. The event handlers can then access this data through the Value property of the ReturnEventArgs<T> object they receive.

Overall, this class provides a simple and type-safe way to include return values in event-driven programming scenarios, which can be particularly useful in situations where you need to gather information or results from multiple event handlers.
