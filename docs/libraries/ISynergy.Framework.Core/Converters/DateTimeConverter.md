# DateTimeConverter Explanation:

The DateTimeConverter is a custom JSON converter designed to handle DateTime objects in a specific way when serializing (converting objects to JSON) and deserializing (converting JSON back to objects) data. This converter is particularly useful when you want to ensure that DateTime values are consistently formatted in your JSON data.

The purpose of this code is to provide a standardized way of representing DateTime objects in JSON format. It does this by implementing two main methods: Read and Write.

The Read method takes JSON input in the form of a string and converts it into a DateTime object. It expects the input to be in a specific format defined by StringFormats.IsoDateTimeFormat (which is likely a constant defined elsewhere in the codebase). This method uses DateTime.ParseExact to ensure that the input string matches the expected format exactly.

The Write method does the opposite: it takes a DateTime object and converts it into a JSON string. It uses the same StringFormats.IsoDateTimeFormat to ensure that the output is consistently formatted.

The converter achieves its purpose by overriding the default JSON serialization and deserialization behavior for DateTime objects. When the JSON serializer encounters a DateTime object, it will use this custom converter instead of the default one.

An important aspect of this converter is that it uses CultureInfo.InvariantCulture when parsing dates. This ensures that the date parsing is consistent regardless of the cultural settings of the system where the code is running.

In simple terms, this code acts like a translator between DateTime objects in your program and their string representation in JSON. It makes sure that dates are always written and read in the same format, which helps prevent errors and inconsistencies when working with dates in JSON data.
