# TreeNode<TKey, TModel> Class

This code defines a class called TreeNode, which is designed to represent a node in a tree data structure. The class is part of the ISynergy.Framework.Core.Collections namespace and is intended to be used for organizing hierarchical data.

The TreeNode class takes two generic type parameters: TKey, which must be a struct (like int or Guid), and TModel, which must be a class. These type parameters allow the TreeNode to be flexible and work with different types of data.

The main purpose of this class is to create a structure that can hold data (of type TModel) and maintain relationships between different nodes in a tree. Each node can have a parent node and multiple child nodes, forming a hierarchical structure.

The class doesn't take any specific inputs when it's created, but it provides properties that can be set to define the node's characteristics:

- IsSelected: A boolean property that indicates whether the node is currently selected.
- IsExpanded: A boolean property that shows whether the node is expanded (i.e., its children are visible).

These properties use GetValue and SetValue methods, which suggest that the class implements some form of property change notification, likely for use in user interfaces that need to update when these values change.

The TreeNode class doesn't produce any direct outputs. Instead, it serves as a container for data and relationships that can be used by other parts of a program to represent and manipulate tree structures.

The class achieves its purpose by providing a way to store and retrieve data associated with each node, as well as maintaining relationships between nodes. While not shown in the provided code snippet, we can infer that there would be additional properties and methods to handle parent-child relationships and to store the actual data of type TModel.

An important aspect of this class is that it inherits from ObservableClass. This suggests that it's designed to work with data binding in user interfaces, allowing the UI to automatically update when properties of the TreeNode change.

In summary, the TreeNode class provides a foundation for creating tree structures in C#, with built-in support for selection, expansion, and likely data binding. It's a versatile class that can be used to represent various hierarchical data structures in applications, such as file systems, organization charts, or nested categories.
