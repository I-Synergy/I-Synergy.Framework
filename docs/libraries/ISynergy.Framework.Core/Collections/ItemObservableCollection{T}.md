# ItemObservableCollection

This code defines a special type of collection called ItemObservableCollection. Its purpose is to create a list of items that can notify listeners when changes occur, not just to the collection itself, but also to the individual items within it.

The collection takes items of type T as input, where T must be a type that implements the INotifyPropertyChanged interface. This means that the items in the collection can notify when their properties change.

The main output of this collection is events. It produces two types of events: one when the collection itself changes (items added or removed), and another when properties of individual items in the collection change.

To achieve its purpose, the code sets up event handlers. When the collection is created, it subscribes to its own CollectionChanged event. This allows it to keep track of new items added to the collection. When new items are added, it subscribes to each item's PropertyChanged event. This way, it can monitor changes to the properties of individual items.

The important logic flow here is the chain of event handling. When an item is added to the collection, the item_CollectionChanged method is called. This method then subscribes to the PropertyChanged event of each new item. When a property of an item changes, the item_PropertyChanged method is triggered, which in turn raises the ItemPropertyChanged event of the collection.

This setup allows users of the collection to easily monitor both changes to the collection itself and changes to the properties of items within the collection. For example, if you had a list of invoices, you could be notified when invoices are added or removed from the list, and also when details of any individual invoice change.

In simple terms, think of it like a smart list that not only tells you when items are added or removed, but also when any detail of any item in the list changes. This can be very useful in programming scenarios where you need to keep track of and respond to various types of changes in your data.
