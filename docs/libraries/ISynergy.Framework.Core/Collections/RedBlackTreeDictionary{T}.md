# RedBlackTreeDictionary<TKey, TValue>

This code defines a custom dictionary class called RedBlackTreeDictionary that uses a red-black tree data structure to store and organize key-value pairs. The purpose of this class is to provide a sorted dictionary implementation that maintains its elements in a specific order based on the keys.

The class takes two type parameters: TKey for the type of keys and TValue for the type of values to be stored in the dictionary. It implements the IDictionary<TKey, TValue> interface, which means it provides standard dictionary functionality like adding, removing, and looking up key-value pairs.

The main input for this class is the key-value pairs that will be stored in the dictionary. The output is the ability to efficiently retrieve, add, or remove these pairs while maintaining a sorted order.

The class achieves its purpose by using a RedBlackTree<TKey, TValue> as its underlying data structure. Red-black trees are self-balancing binary search trees that ensure efficient operations (like insertion, deletion, and lookup) with a time complexity of O(log n) in the worst case.

The class has two private fields: _tree, which is the actual red-black tree storing the data, and _values and _keys, which are collections used for iterating over the dictionary's values and keys respectively.

The constructor of the class initializes the dictionary with a default comparer for the key type. This comparer determines how the keys will be ordered in the tree. By using the default comparer, the dictionary will sort keys based on their natural ordering (e.g., alphabetical order for strings, numerical order for numbers).

Overall, this class provides a way to create a sorted dictionary that maintains its elements in order automatically. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to keep data sorted and perform operations like finding the minimum or maximum key efficiently.
