# OrderedDictionary<TKey, TValue>

This code defines a custom data structure called OrderedDictionary<TKey, TValue>, which combines features of both a dictionary and a list. Its purpose is to store key-value pairs while maintaining the order in which items were added.

The OrderedDictionary takes two type parameters: TKey for the type of keys and TValue for the type of values. It doesn't require any specific input when created, but users can add key-value pairs to it after initialization.

As output, this data structure allows users to retrieve values by their keys, get keys or values by their index in the order they were added, and iterate through the items in the order they were inserted.

The OrderedDictionary achieves its purpose by using two internal data structures: a Dictionary<TKey, TValue> for fast key-based lookups and a List to maintain the order of keys. When items are added, they're stored in both the dictionary and the list. This allows the class to provide quick access to values by their keys (using the dictionary) while also maintaining the insertion order (using the list).

The class implements various methods to manipulate the data, such as Add, Remove, and Clear. When adding an item, it's placed in both the dictionary and the list. When removing an item, it's taken out of both structures. This ensures that the two internal data structures always stay in sync.

One important feature is the ability to access items by their index. The GetKeyByIndex and GetValueByIndex methods allow users to retrieve items based on their position in the order they were added, which is not possible with a standard dictionary.

The class also implements several interfaces, including IDictionary<TKey, TValue>, which allows it to be used anywhere a standard dictionary is expected, while providing the additional benefit of maintaining order.

In summary, the OrderedDictionary provides a way to store and retrieve key-value pairs while keeping track of the order in which they were added. This can be useful in scenarios where both fast key-based lookups and ordered iteration are needed.
