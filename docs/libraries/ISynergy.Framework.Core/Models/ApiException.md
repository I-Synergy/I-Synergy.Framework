# ApiException.cs

This code defines a custom exception class called ApiException, which is designed to handle errors specifically related to API operations in a software application. The purpose of this class is to provide more detailed information about errors that occur during API interactions, allowing developers to better understand and handle these errors.

The ApiException class extends the built-in Exception class, which means it inherits all the basic functionality of a standard exception while adding its own specific features. The main addition to this custom exception is the "Type" property, which allows developers to categorize different kinds of API errors.

The class provides two constructors (ways to create a new instance of the class):

- A default constructor that doesn't take any inputs. This allows developers to create a basic ApiException without providing any additional information.

- A more detailed constructor that takes two inputs: a message (which is a string describing the error) and a type (which is also a string, used to categorize the error). This constructor allows developers to provide more specific information about the error that occurred.

When using the second constructor, the message is passed to the base Exception class (using the "base" keyword), which sets up the basic exception information. The "Type" property is then set using the provided type input.

The ApiException class doesn't produce any direct outputs. Instead, it's typically used in a "throw" statement within other parts of the code. When an ApiException is thrown, it can be caught and handled elsewhere in the program, allowing developers to respond appropriately to different types of API errors.

The main purpose of this class is to improve error handling and debugging in API-related code. By using a custom exception with a "Type" property, developers can create more specific error messages and implement more targeted error-handling strategies. This can lead to more robust and maintainable code, especially in applications that interact heavily with APIs.
