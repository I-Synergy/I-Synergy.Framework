# PaginatedResult Class Explanation:

The PaginatedResult class is designed to handle and represent paginated data in a structured way. It's particularly useful when dealing with large sets of data that need to be divided into smaller, manageable chunks or pages.

This class takes a generic type T, which means it can work with any data type. It inherits from a base class called Result, suggesting it's part of a larger system for handling operation results.

The main purpose of this class is to store and provide access to a subset of data along with information about the current page, total number of pages, and other pagination-related details. It takes inputs such as the actual data (of type T), the current page number, total count of items, and page size.

The class has two constructors. The first one is a simple public constructor that takes only the data as input. The second constructor is more comprehensive and internal, meaning it's only accessible within the same assembly. This internal constructor takes several parameters including a success flag, the data, error messages, total count, current page, and page size.

The internal constructor performs some important calculations. It sets the provided data, current page, and success status. It also calculates the total number of pages by dividing the total count by the page size and rounding up to the nearest integer. This calculation is crucial for determining how many pages are needed to display all the data.

The outputs of this class are the properties it exposes: Data (the actual paginated data), CurrentPage, TotalPages, TotalCount, and PageSize. These allow users of the class to access both the data and the pagination information.

In terms of logic flow, when an instance of PaginatedResult is created, it organizes the input data and pagination information into a structured format. This makes it easy for other parts of the program to work with paginated data, knowing exactly what page they're on, how many items are on each page, and how many pages there are in total.

Overall, this class serves as a container for paginated data, providing a clean and organized way to handle data that needs to be split across multiple pages. It's a useful tool for scenarios like displaying search results or long lists of items in a user interface where you want to show the data in manageable chunks.
