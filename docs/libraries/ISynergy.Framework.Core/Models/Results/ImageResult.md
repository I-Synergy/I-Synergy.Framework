# ImageResult Class Explanation:

The ImageResult class is a specialized version of a Result class designed to handle image-related operations. Its purpose is to encapsulate the outcome of an image processing task, including success or failure status, associated messages, and the image data itself.

This class takes two main inputs: a byte array representing the image file data (FileBytes) and a string indicating the content type of the image (ContentType). These inputs are stored as properties of the class.

The ImageResult class doesn't produce a direct output, but rather serves as a container for the result of an image operation. It can be used to return information about whether an operation succeeded or failed, along with any relevant messages or the processed image data.

The class achieves its purpose through several constructor methods and static factory methods. The default constructor creates an empty ImageResult, while another constructor allows setting the FileBytes and ContentType. The static methods (Fail and FailAsync) create ImageResult instances representing failed operations, optionally including error messages.

The important logic flow in this class revolves around creating and returning ImageResult objects with different states. The Fail methods set the Succeeded property to false and optionally add error messages. The FailAsync methods wrap these results in Tasks for asynchronous operations.

This class is designed to make it easy for programmers to create and return standardized results for image processing operations. It allows for clear communication of success or failure, along with any relevant data or error messages, in a consistent format across different parts of a program dealing with images.
