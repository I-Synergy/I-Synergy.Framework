# TokenRequest Record

This code defines a record called TokenRequest in the ISynergy.Framework.Core.Models namespace. The purpose of this record is to encapsulate information needed to request a token, typically used in authentication systems.

The TokenRequest record takes four inputs:

- Username: A string representing the user's name.
- Claims: A collection of key-value pairs (KeyValuePair<string, string>) that represent additional information about the user.
- Roles: A collection of strings that represent the roles assigned to the user.
- Expiration: A TimeSpan value that indicates how long the token should be valid.

The record doesn't produce any direct outputs. Instead, it serves as a data container that holds all the necessary information for creating a token request.

The TokenRequest achieves its purpose by providing a structured way to package all the required information for a token request. It uses C#'s record feature, which automatically creates immutable properties for each of the constructor parameters. This means that once a TokenRequest is created, its values cannot be changed, ensuring data integrity.

The important aspects of this code are:

- It uses a record instead of a class, which is ideal for immutable data structures.
- It provides clear documentation for each property and the constructor using XML comments.
- It uses IEnumerable for Claims and Roles, allowing for flexible collection types to be passed in.

This record can be used in a larger authentication system where it would be passed to a method that generates actual tokens based on the information contained within the TokenRequest. The use of a record ensures that all necessary information is provided at the time of creation and cannot be altered afterwards, which is important for security in authentication systems.
