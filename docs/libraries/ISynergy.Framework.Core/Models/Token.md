# Token.cs

This code defines a Token record in C#, which is used to represent and store information about an authentication token. The purpose of this code is to create a structured way to handle token data that might be received from an authentication server or API.

The Token record doesn't take any direct inputs or produce any outputs. Instead, it serves as a data container or model to hold various pieces of information related to an authentication token. This information can be used by other parts of the program that need to work with authentication tokens.

The Token record contains five properties:

- AccessToken: A string that represents the actual access token used for authentication.
- IdToken: A string that represents an identifier token, which might contain additional user information.
- RefreshToken: A string used to obtain a new access token when the current one expires.
- ExpiresIn: An integer that likely represents the number of seconds until the token expires.
- TokenType: A string that indicates the type of token (e.g., "Bearer").

Each of these properties is decorated with a [JsonPropertyName] attribute. This attribute is used to map the property names to different names when the Token record is serialized to or deserialized from JSON format. For example, "AccessToken" in the code will be represented as "access_token" in JSON.

The code achieves its purpose by providing a clear structure for token data. When a program needs to work with authentication tokens, it can create instances of this Token record and easily access or modify the various pieces of token information through the defined properties.

While there's no complex logic or data transformation happening in this code, it's important to note that using a record (introduced in C# 9.0) instead of a class provides some benefits. Records are immutable by default and provide value-based equality, which can be useful when working with token data that shouldn't be changed after creation.

In summary, this Token record serves as a blueprint for creating objects that represent authentication tokens, making it easier for developers to work with token data in a structured and consistent way throughout their application.
