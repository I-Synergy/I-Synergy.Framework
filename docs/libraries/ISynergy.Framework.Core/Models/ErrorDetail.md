# ErrorDetail Class

This code defines a class called ErrorDetail, which is designed to represent and store information about errors that might occur in a software application. The purpose of this class is to provide a structured way to capture and manage error details, making it easier for developers to handle and report errors in their programs.

The ErrorDetail class doesn't take any direct inputs or produce any outputs on its own. Instead, it serves as a container for error-related information. It has properties to store different aspects of an error, such as the status code, error message, stack trace, and error type.

The class provides two ways to create an ErrorDetail object:

- A default constructor that creates an empty ErrorDetail object, allowing developers to set the properties later.
- A parameterized constructor that takes four inputs: statusCode (an integer), message (a string), stacktrace (a string), and type (a string). This constructor allows developers to create an ErrorDetail object with all its properties set at once.

The ErrorDetail class doesn't contain any complex algorithms or data transformations. Its main purpose is to group related error information together in a single object, making it easier to pass around and work with error details in a program.

The class includes XML documentation comments, which provide descriptions for the class itself, its constructors, and its properties. These comments are helpful for developers using this class, as they explain what each part of the class does and what kind of information should be stored in each property.

While not shown in the provided code snippet, the class likely includes getter and setter methods for each property (StatusCode, Message, StackTrace, and Type), allowing developers to read and modify these values as needed.

In summary, the ErrorDetail class provides a simple and organized way to store and manage information about errors in a program, which can be useful for error handling, logging, and debugging purposes.
