# TileItem

The TileItem class in src\ISynergy.Framework.Core\Models\TileItem.cs is a model that represents a tile item in a user interface. This class is designed to store and manage various properties of a tile, such as its name, group, and description.

The purpose of this code is to create a reusable structure for tile items that can be used throughout an application. It provides a way to store and retrieve information about each tile, which can be useful for displaying tiles in a user interface or managing tile-related data.

This class doesn't take any direct inputs or produce any outputs on its own. Instead, it serves as a container for data that can be set and retrieved by other parts of the application.

The TileItem class achieves its purpose by inheriting from a BaseModel class and implementing properties using a specific pattern. Each property in the class follows the same structure:

- It has a public getter and setter.
- The getter calls a method called GetValue() where T is the type of the property.
- The setter calls a method called SetValue() with the new value as an argument.

This pattern suggests that the BaseModel class (which we don't see in this code snippet) likely handles the actual storage and retrieval of the property values, as well as any additional functionality like property change notifications or validation.

The important properties defined in this part of the class are:

- Name: A string representing the name of the tile.
- Group: A string representing the group or category the tile belongs to.
- Description: A string providing a description of the tile.

These properties allow the application to store and retrieve basic information about each tile. The use of the GetValue and SetValue methods suggests that there might be some additional logic happening behind the scenes, such as notifying the user interface when a property changes or performing some kind of validation on the values.

Overall, this class provides a structured way to represent tile items in the application, making it easier to manage and display tile-related data consistently throughout the program.
