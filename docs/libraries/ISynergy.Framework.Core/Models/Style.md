# Style

The Style class in src\ISynergy.Framework.Core\Models\Style.cs is a model that represents the visual style of an application. It's designed to store and manage information about the color and theme of the application's user interface.

The purpose of this code is to create a reusable structure for handling application styling. It allows developers to easily set and retrieve color and theme information for their application.

This class doesn't take any direct inputs or produce any outputs on its own. Instead, it provides properties that can be set and retrieved by other parts of the application. These properties are:

- Color: A string that represents the color of the application's interface.
- Theme: An enumeration (Themes) that represents the overall theme of the application.

The Style class achieves its purpose by inheriting from ObservableClass, which likely provides functionality for notifying other parts of the application when these properties change. This is important for keeping the user interface up-to-date with any style changes.

The class uses a pattern where the actual values are stored and retrieved using GetValue and SetValue methods. This suggests that there's some additional logic happening behind the scenes, possibly for validation or notification purposes.

The [Bindable(BindableSupport.Yes)] attribute at the class level indicates that this class is designed to work with data binding systems, which are common in user interface frameworks. This allows the properties of the Style class to be easily connected to UI elements.

In simple terms, you can think of this Style class as a container for holding information about how an application should look. Other parts of the application can ask this container for the current color or theme, or they can update these values when the user wants to change the application's appearance. The class is set up in a way that makes it easy to use with modern user interface systems, ensuring that when the style changes, the application's look updates accordingly.
