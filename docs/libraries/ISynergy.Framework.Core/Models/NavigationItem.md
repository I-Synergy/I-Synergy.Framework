# NavigationItem Class Explanation:

The NavigationItem class is designed to represent an item in a navigation menu or list. Its purpose is to store information about a single navigation option, such as its name, whether it's selected, and what action should be taken when it's chosen.

This class doesn't take any direct inputs or produce any outputs on its own. Instead, it serves as a data structure to hold various properties related to a navigation item. These properties can be set and retrieved by other parts of the program that use this class.

The NavigationItem class achieves its purpose by defining several properties that describe different aspects of a navigation item:

- IsSelected: A boolean (true/false) value that indicates whether this item is currently selected in the navigation menu.
- Name: A string that represents the display name of the navigation item.
- Command: An ICommand object that represents the action to be executed when this item is selected.
- CommandParameter: An object that can hold additional data to be passed to the Command when it's executed.

The class uses C# properties, which are special methods that allow reading and writing values in a controlled manner. Most properties in this class have both a getter (get) and a setter (set), allowing them to be both read and modified. The Command property, however, has a private setter, meaning it can only be set within the class itself.

While this code snippet doesn't show the full implementation, it provides the structure for creating and managing navigation items. Other parts of the program can create instances of NavigationItem, set their properties, and use them to build a navigation system. For example, a list of NavigationItem objects could be used to populate a menu, where selecting an item would trigger its associated Command.

The class is marked as partial, which means its definition might be split across multiple files. This allows for potential extension of the class in other parts of the codebase.

Overall, the NavigationItem class serves as a building block for creating navigation systems in an application, providing a structured way to represent and manage individual navigation options.
