# Country.cs

The Country.cs file defines a Country record in C#, which is part of the ISynergy.Framework.Core.Models namespace. This code aims to create a structured representation of a country with various attributes.

The purpose of this code is to define a data model for storing and managing information about countries. It doesn't take any direct inputs or produce any outputs on its own. Instead, it serves as a blueprint for creating Country objects that can be used throughout an application.

The Country record inherits from BaseRecord, which likely provides some common functionality for all records in the system. It includes several properties that represent different aspects of a country:

- CountryId: An integer that uniquely identifies each country.
- ISO2Code: A string representing the two-letter ISO code for the country.
- CountryISO: A string for the full ISO code of the country.

Each property is decorated with attributes that provide additional information or constraints:

- The [Identity] attribute on CountryId suggests that this is the primary identifier for a Country object.
- The [Required] attribute indicates that these properties must have a value and cannot be null.
- The [StringLength] attribute on ISO2Code and CountryISO specifies the maximum length of these strings.
- This structure allows developers to create Country objects with consistent and validated data. For example, it ensures that the ISO2Code is always exactly two characters long, which is the standard for country codes.

The code achieves its purpose by using C#'s record feature, which automatically provides value-based equality, immutability, and other useful features for data objects. The attributes applied to each property help enforce data integrity and provide metadata that can be used by other parts of the system, such as validation logic or database mapping tools.

While this code doesn't contain complex algorithms or data transformations, it sets up a robust structure for representing country data. This structure can then be used in other parts of the application for tasks like storing country information, validating user inputs, or displaying country details in a user interface.
