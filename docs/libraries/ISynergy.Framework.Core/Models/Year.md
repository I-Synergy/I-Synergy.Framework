# Year.cs

The Year.cs file defines a simple data structure called "Year" in the ISynergy.Framework.Core.Models namespace. This code is designed to represent a year with two pieces of information: a numeric value and a descriptive text.

The purpose of this code is to create a reusable structure for storing and working with year-related data in a program. It doesn't perform any complex operations but rather serves as a container for year information.

This Year record doesn't take any direct inputs when it's created. Instead, it provides properties that can be set after an instance of Year is created. It has two main components:

- Value: This is an integer (whole number) that represents the actual year number, like 2023 or 1995.
- Description: This is a string (text) that can hold additional information or a description related to the year.

The code doesn't produce any outputs on its own. It's a data structure that other parts of a program can use to store and retrieve year information.

The Year record achieves its purpose by using C#'s record type, which is a simple way to create a class-like structure with built-in value equality and immutability support. It defines two properties:

- The Value property, which is an integer that can be get (retrieved) or set (assigned a value).
- The Description property, which is a string that can also be get or set. It's initialized with an empty string by default.

There aren't any complex logic flows or data transformations happening in this code. It's a straightforward definition of a data structure. The main point to understand is that this Year record provides a convenient way to package a year's numeric value along with a descriptive text about that year.

For example, a programmer could use this Year record to create instances like:

- A Year with Value 2023 and Description "Current year"
- A Year with Value 1969 and Description "Moon landing"

This structure allows for easy organization and manipulation of year-related data in other parts of the program that might need to work with years and associated information.
