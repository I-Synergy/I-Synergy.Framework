# User.cs

This code defines a basic structure for representing a user in a software system. It's part of a larger framework for managing accounts and is located in the ISynergy.Framework.Core.Models.Accounts namespace.

The purpose of this code is to create a template or blueprint for what information a user should have in the system. It doesn't perform any actions itself but instead defines what data can be stored about a user.

This User record doesn't take any direct inputs or produce any outputs. Instead, it defines properties that can be set and retrieved when working with user data in other parts of the application.

The User record achieves its purpose by declaring three main pieces of information that every user should have:

- An Id (a unique identifier for each user)
- A UserName (the name the user goes by in the system)
- An IsUnlocked status (whether the user's account is locked or not)
Each of these properties is marked as [Required], which means they must have a value and cannot be left empty when creating or modifying a user.

The User record inherits from BaseRecord, which likely provides some common functionality or properties that all records in the system share. This inheritance allows the User record to be part of a larger, organized structure within the application.

In terms of data flow, when other parts of the application need to work with user data, they can create instances of this User record, set the properties (Id, UserName, and IsUnlocked), and then use or store this information as needed. The record structure allows for easy creation and manipulation of user data throughout the application.

This code serves as a foundation for user management in the system. Other parts of the application can build upon this basic user structure to implement more complex functionality like user authentication, authorization, or profile management.
