# Currency.cs

This code defines a Currency record, which is a data structure used to represent currency information in a program. The purpose of this code is to create a reusable model for storing and managing currency-related data.

The Currency record doesn't take any direct inputs or produce any outputs on its own. Instead, it defines a structure that can be used to create and manipulate currency objects throughout the program.

The Currency record achieves its purpose by defining several properties that represent different aspects of a currency:

- CurrencyId: An integer that uniquely identifies the currency.
- Code: A string of up to 3 characters representing the currency code (e.g., "USD" for US Dollars).
- Description: A string of up to 255 characters providing a description of the currency.
- CurrencySymbol: A string of up to 3 characters representing the currency symbol (e.g., "$" for US Dollars).
- Rate: A decimal number representing the exchange rate of the currency.
- RateDate: A DateTimeOffset value indicating when the exchange rate was last updated.

The code uses attributes (like [Required] and [StringLength]) to add validation rules to the properties. These attributes help ensure that the data stored in Currency objects is valid and consistent.

The Currency record inherits from BaseRecord, which likely provides some common functionality for all record types in the application. By using a record instead of a class, the code takes advantage of built-in value equality and immutability features, which can be helpful for managing currency data.

While this code doesn't contain any complex algorithms or data transformations, it sets up a structured way to represent currency information. This structure can be used throughout the application to store, retrieve, and manipulate currency data consistently.
