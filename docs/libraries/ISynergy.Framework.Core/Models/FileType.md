# FileType.cs

This code defines a class called FileType, which is designed to represent different types of files in a program. The purpose of this class is to store and provide information about various file types, such as their identifiers, descriptions, file extensions, whether they are image files, and their content types.

The FileType class is created as a sealed record, which means it's immutable (its values can't be changed after creation) and can't be inherited by other classes. It takes five inputs when creating a new FileType object:

- An integer id: This serves as a unique identifier for the file type.
- A string description: This provides a human-readable description of the file type.
- A string extension: This represents the file extension (e.g., ".txt", ".jpg").
- A boolean isImage: This indicates whether the file type is an image or not.
- A string contentType: This specifies the MIME content type of the file.

When a new FileType object is created, these inputs are used to initialize the object's properties. The class doesn't produce any direct outputs, but it allows other parts of the program to access this information about file types.

The class achieves its purpose by storing the input data in properties that can be accessed later. Each property is defined with a public getter, which means other parts of the program can read these values but can't change them (making the object immutable).

There isn't any complex logic or data transformation happening in this class. Its main function is to act as a data container, holding related information about a file type in one place. This can be useful for organizing and managing different file types within a larger application.

For example, a program might create several FileType objects to represent different kinds of files it can handle (like text files, images, or documents). It could then use these objects to determine how to process or display files based on their type.
