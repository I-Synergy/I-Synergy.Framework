# BaseClass.cs

This code defines a base class called BaseClass that serves as a foundation for other classes in the ISynergy.Framework.Core library. The purpose of this class is to provide common properties and functionality that can be inherited by other classes, ensuring consistency across the codebase.

The BaseClass doesn't take any direct inputs or produce any outputs on its own. Instead, it defines two properties that will be available to any class that inherits from it:

- Version: An integer property that represents the version of the object.
- IsDeleted: A boolean property that indicates whether the object has been marked as deleted.

Both of these properties are marked with the [Required] attribute, which means they must have a value assigned to them when an object is created.

The class achieves its purpose by providing a common structure for other classes to build upon. By inheriting from BaseClass, other classes automatically gain the Version and IsDeleted properties, as well as any methods or behaviors defined in the IClass interface (which BaseClass implements, although the interface details are not shown in this code snippet).

There isn't any complex logic or data transformation happening within this class. Its main function is to serve as a template or starting point for other classes. The abstract keyword in the class declaration means that BaseClass cannot be instantiated on its own â€“ it must be inherited by other classes.

The class is designed to support serialization (converting objects to a format that can be easily stored or transmitted), property changed notifications (alerting other parts of the program when a property value changes), backwards compatibility (ensuring newer versions of the class can work with older versions of the software), and error checking (through the use of the [Required] attribute).

In summary, BaseClass provides a consistent foundation for other classes in the framework, ensuring that all objects have version tracking and a way to mark them as deleted, while also supporting important features like serialization and data validation.
