# Property Class Explanation:

The Property class is a generic class designed to represent a property with a value of type T. Its purpose is to provide a way to manage and track changes to a property's value, which can be useful in scenarios where you need to know if a property has been modified or if you want to revert changes.

This class doesn't take any direct inputs, but it is designed to store and manage a value of type T. The outputs it produces are the current value, the original value, and information about whether the property has been changed.

The class achieves its purpose by maintaining two main pieces of data: the current value (_value) and the original value (_originalValue). It also keeps track of whether the property has been modified (_isDirty) and if the original value has been set (_isOriginalSet).

The important logic flows in this class revolve around setting and getting the value, and managing the "dirty" state of the property. When a value is set, the class checks if it's the first time a value is being set (to establish the original value). It then updates the current value, marks the property as "dirty" (indicating it has been changed), and triggers a ValueChanged event to notify any listeners that the value has been modified.

The class provides methods to reset changes (reverting to the original value) and to mark the property as "clean" (accepting the current value as the new original value). These features allow for easy management of property changes, which can be particularly useful in user interface scenarios where you might want to undo changes or save new values.

In simple terms, this class acts like a smart container for a value. It remembers what the value was originally, knows if it has been changed, and can tell you about these changes or even undo them if needed. This can be very helpful when you're building applications where you need to keep track of data changes, such as in forms or data editing interfaces.
