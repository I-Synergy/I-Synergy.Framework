# BaseRecord.cs

This code defines an abstract record called BaseRecord, which serves as a foundation for other record types in the ISynergy.Framework.Core.Base namespace. The purpose of this code is to provide a common set of properties that can be inherited by other records, ensuring consistency across different data structures in the application.

BaseRecord doesn't take any direct inputs or produce any outputs. Instead, it defines a set of properties that can be used to store and retrieve information about a record. These properties include:

- Version: An integer representing the version of the record.
- Memo: A string for storing additional notes or comments.
- CreatedDate: A DateTimeOffset indicating when the record was created.
- ChangedDate: A nullable DateTimeOffset showing when the record was last modified.
- CreatedBy: A string identifying who created the record.
- ChangedBy: A string identifying who last changed the record.

The code achieves its purpose by declaring these properties with public getters and setters, allowing them to be easily accessed and modified by other parts of the program that use this record type. By making BaseRecord abstract, it ensures that this record cannot be instantiated on its own but must be inherited by other, more specific record types.

The main logic flow in this code is the inheritance from the IRecord interface, which likely defines the contract for what properties a record should have. BaseRecord implements this interface, providing concrete implementations for the required properties.

While there are no complex algorithms or data transformations happening in this code, it sets up a structure for tracking important metadata about records, such as their creation and modification details. This can be crucial for auditing, versioning, and managing data in a larger application.

Overall, BaseRecord serves as a building block for creating more specific record types that will inherit these common properties, promoting code reuse and maintaining a consistent structure across different data entities in the system.
