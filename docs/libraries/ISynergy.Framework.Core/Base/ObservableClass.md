# ObservableClass Explanation:

The ObservableClass is a foundational abstract class in the ISynergy.Framework.Core.Base namespace. Its purpose is to provide a base implementation for objects that need to be observable, meaning their property changes can be tracked and validated.

This class doesn't take any direct inputs or produce any outputs. Instead, it sets up a structure that other classes can inherit from to gain observable and validation capabilities.

The main feature introduced in this code snippet is the AutomaticValidationTrigger property. This boolean property determines whether validation should be performed automatically when a property value changes. It uses custom GetValue and SetValue methods, which are likely defined elsewhere in the class, to handle the property's value.

The AutomaticValidationTrigger property is decorated with several attributes:

- [JsonIgnore]: This tells JSON serializers to ignore this property when converting the object to JSON.
- [DataTableIgnore]: This likely tells some custom data table functionality to ignore this property.
- [XmlIgnore]: This tells XML serializers to ignore this property when converting the object to XML.
- [Display(AutoGenerateField = false)]: This indicates that UI generators should not automatically create a field for this property.

These attributes suggest that AutomaticValidationTrigger is meant for internal use within the object and should not be persisted or displayed directly.

The class inherits from IObservableClass, which is likely an interface that defines the contract for observable classes in this framework. By inheriting from this interface, ObservableClass promises to implement certain methods and properties that make objects observable.

In summary, ObservableClass sets up a foundation for creating objects whose property changes can be observed and validated. It introduces the concept of automatic validation triggering, which can be turned on or off. This class is meant to be inherited by other classes that need these capabilities, providing a consistent way to handle property changes and validation across the application.
