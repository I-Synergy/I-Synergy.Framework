# NumericRange.cs

This code defines a structure called NumericRange, which represents a range of double-precision floating-point numbers. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to work with number ranges, allowing users to perform various operations and checks on these ranges.

The NumericRange structure doesn't take any direct inputs when it's created. Instead, it's designed to be instantiated with a minimum and maximum value, which define the boundaries of the range. For example, you could create a range from 0.25 to 1.5.

The structure doesn't produce any direct outputs, but it provides methods that return information about the range or perform comparisons. These methods can be used to check if a number is inside the range, if one range is inside another, or if two ranges overlap.

The code achieves its purpose by storing the minimum and maximum values of the range and providing methods to interact with these values. It uses simple comparison operations to determine relationships between numbers and ranges.

Some important operations that can be performed with this structure include:

- Checking if a specific number is inside the range.
- Checking if one range is completely inside another range.
- Checking if two ranges overlap with each other.

The code uses a simple and intuitive approach to represent ranges. By storing just two values (minimum and maximum), it can represent any continuous range of numbers. This makes it easy for beginners to understand and use.

The example provided in the code comments shows how to create two ranges and perform some basic checks. This gives users a clear idea of how they might use this structure in their own programs, such as checking if a value falls within a certain range or determining if two ranges have any numbers in common.

Overall, this code provides a useful tool for working with number ranges, which can be helpful in many programming scenarios, such as data validation, numerical analysis, or any situation where you need to work with intervals of numbers.
