# NetworkUtility Class Explanation:

The NetworkUtility class is a collection of static methods designed to help with various network-related tasks. This class provides two main functions: checking internet connectivity and validating IP addresses.

The first method, IsInternetConnectionAvailable(), aims to determine if an internet connection is available. It doesn't take any input parameters. The method returns a Task, which means it's an asynchronous operation that will eventually result in a true or false value. To check the internet connection, it sends a ping (a small network message) to Google's DNS server (8.8.8.8). If the ping is successful, it means there's an internet connection, and the method returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

The second method, IsValidIP(string TestAddress), is used to check if a given string represents a valid IP address. It takes a single input: a string representing the IP address to be tested. The method returns a boolean value: true if the input is a valid IP address, and false if it's not. To determine if the IP address is valid, it uses a complex regular expression (a pattern-matching tool) to check if the input string matches the format of various types of IP addresses, including IPv4 and some special formats.

Both methods use different approaches to achieve their purposes. IsInternetConnectionAvailable() actively tests the network by sending a ping, while IsValidIP() passively examines the structure of the input string without making any network calls.

The logic flow in IsInternetConnectionAvailable() is straightforward: create a Ping object, send a ping, and return the result based on whether the ping was successful. In IsValidIP(), the entire logic is encapsulated in the regular expression match. The regular expression is complex and covers various IP address formats, making the method flexible in recognizing different types of valid IP addresses.

These utilities can be useful in various scenarios, such as checking network status before performing network-dependent operations, or validating user input when an IP address is required.
