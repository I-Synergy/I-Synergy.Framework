# CompareUtility

CompareUtility is a static class that provides methods for comparing objects and values. This utility class is designed to help programmers compare different types of data in various ways.

The class contains two main methods: CompareObject and Compare. Let's look at each of them:

1. CompareObject: This method takes two objects as input (source and destination) and compares their properties. It returns a list of strings describing the differences between the two objects. Here's how it works:

- It gets the type of the source object.
- It then uses LINQ (Language Integrated Query) to iterate through all the properties of the object.
- For each property, it compares the values in the source and destination objects.
- If the values are different, it creates a string describing the difference, including the property name and the old and new values.
- Finally, it returns a list of all these difference descriptions.

This method is useful when you want to see how two objects of the same type differ from each other, property by property.

2. Compare: This method is overloaded, meaning there are two versions of it:

a. The first version takes a string operation (like "==", "!=", ">", ">=", "<", "<=") and two values of the same type T, where T must implement IComparable. It returns a boolean result based on the comparison of the two values using the specified operation.

b. The second version (not fully shown in the provided code) seems to do a similar comparison but for objects that may not implement IComparable.

Both versions of Compare are useful when you want to perform a specific comparison operation between two values or objects and get a true/false result.

The CompareUtility class provides a convenient way to perform comparisons in different scenarios, whether you're comparing entire objects or individual values. It abstracts away some of the complexity of comparisons, making it easier for programmers to write code that involves comparing data.
