# RegexUtility.cs

This code defines a utility class called RegexUtility that provides methods for converting mask patterns into regular expressions (regex). The purpose of this code is to make it easier for programmers to create regex patterns from simpler mask formats.

The class contains two main methods:

- MaskToRegexConverter: This method takes a string mask as input and returns a Regex object. It uses the MaskToRegexStringConverter method to convert the mask to a regex pattern string, then creates a new Regex object with this pattern.

- MaskToRegexStringConverter: This method takes a string mask as input and returns a string representing a regex pattern. It processes each character in the mask and converts it to an appropriate regex pattern.

The input for both methods is a string mask, which is a simplified pattern representation. The output of MaskToRegexConverter is a Regex object, while MaskToRegexStringConverter produces a string containing the regex pattern.

The code achieves its purpose by iterating through each character in the input mask and translating it into corresponding regex syntax. It uses a switch statement to handle different mask characters, each representing a specific pattern. For example, '0' is converted to '\d' (any digit), '9' to '[\d]?' (optional digit), and 'L' to '[a-z]' or '[A-Z]' (lowercase or uppercase letter) depending on the current case setting.

An important aspect of the logic is the handling of letter case. The code keeps track of whether the current mode is "capital" or not, which affects how certain characters are translated. This allows the mask to specify uppercase or lowercase letters using special characters like '<', '>', and '|'.

The code builds up the regex pattern piece by piece in a List, which is finally joined together to create the complete regex pattern string. This approach allows for efficient string manipulation without creating many intermediate string objects.

Overall, this utility simplifies the process of creating complex regex patterns by allowing users to specify simpler mask patterns, which the code then translates into full regex syntax. This can be particularly useful for tasks like input validation or pattern matching where regex is commonly used.
