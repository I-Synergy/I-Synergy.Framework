# EnumUtility.cs

This code defines a static class called EnumUtility, which provides helper methods for working with enums in C#. Enums are a special type in C# used to represent a set of named constants.

The purpose of this code is to offer two main functionalities:

- ThrowIfUndefined: This method checks if a given value is defined in an enum type. If it's not, it throws an exception.

- TryToEnum: This method attempts to convert a string to an enum value.

The ThrowIfUndefined method takes two inputs: the enum type and a value to check. It doesn't produce any output directly, but it will throw an UnexpectedEnumValueException if the value is not defined in the enum. This is useful for validating enum values and ensuring that only valid enum values are used in a program.

The TryToEnum method takes a string input and attempts to convert it to an enum value of type T. It produces two outputs: a boolean indicating whether the conversion was successful, and the converted enum value (or a default value if the conversion failed). This method is helpful when you need to convert user input or data from external sources into enum values.

The ThrowIfUndefined method achieves its purpose by using the Enum.IsDefined method to check if the value exists in the enum. If it doesn't, it throws an exception.

The TryToEnum method uses a more complex approach. It loops through all the names in the enum type, looking for a match between the input string and the EnumMember attribute value of each enum member. If a match is found, it parses the enum value and returns true. If no match is found, it returns false.

An important logic flow in the TryToEnum method is the use of reflection to access the EnumMemberAttribute of each enum value. This allows the method to compare the input string against the string value specified in the EnumMember attribute, rather than just the name of the enum value itself.

Overall, this code provides useful utilities for working with enums, helping to ensure type safety and easier conversion between strings and enum values.
