# DelayTimer.cs

This code defines a class called DelayTimer, which is designed to create a timer that repeatedly performs an action at specified intervals. The purpose of this code is to provide a simple way to execute a task periodically without blocking the main program execution.

The DelayTimer class implements an interface called ITimer, which suggests that it's part of a larger system for handling timed operations. The class has a single method called Start, which takes two inputs:

- An interval of type TimeSpan, which determines how long to wait between each execution of the task.
- A step function of type Func, which is the action to be performed at each interval.

The Start method doesn't produce any direct output. Instead, it repeatedly calls the provided step function at the specified intervals. The method runs asynchronously, meaning it won't block other parts of the program while it's running.

Here's how the DelayTimer achieves its purpose:

- It first calls the step function and stores the result in a variable called shouldContinue.
- It then enters a while loop that continues as long as shouldContinue is true.
- Inside the loop, it waits for the specified interval using Task.Delay.
- After the delay, it calls the step function again and updates the shouldContinue variable.
- This process repeats until the step function returns false, at which point the loop ends and the timer stops.

The important logic flow in this code is the continuous cycle of waiting for the specified interval and then executing the step function. This creates a timer-like behavior where the step function is called repeatedly at regular intervals.

One key aspect of this implementation is that it uses Task.Delay instead of a traditional timer. This approach is more efficient in certain scenarios, especially in asynchronous programming environments. It allows the program to perform other tasks while waiting for the next interval, rather than blocking the entire thread.

In summary, the DelayTimer class provides a simple way to repeatedly execute a task at specified intervals, continuing until the task itself indicates it should stop. This can be useful for various applications, such as polling for updates, performing regular maintenance tasks, or implementing game loops.
