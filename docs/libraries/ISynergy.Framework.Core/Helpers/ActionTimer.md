# ActionTimer.cs

This code defines a static class called ActionTimer, which is designed to provide a way to create and manage timers for executing actions repeatedly. Let's break down its purpose and functionality:

- Purpose: The main purpose of this code is to set up a framework for creating timers that can execute actions at regular intervals. It provides a flexible way to instantiate these timers through a factory method.

- Inputs: The code doesn't directly take any inputs. However, it sets up a mechanism (the Create property) that allows users of this class to provide a method for creating timer instances.

- Outputs: The code doesn't produce any direct outputs. Instead, it provides a way to create timer objects that can be used elsewhere in the program to perform timed actions.

- How it achieves its purpose: The ActionTimer class achieves its purpose by defining a static property called Create. This property is of type Func, which means it's a function that returns an ITimer object. The Create property is initialized with a default function that creates a new DelayTimer object.

- Important logic flows: The main logic in this code is the ability to set or get the Create property. This allows users of the ActionTimer class to either use the default timer creation method (which creates a DelayTimer) or to provide their own custom method for creating timer objects.

In simpler terms, think of ActionTimer as a tool that helps you set up timers in your program. It's like having a timer factory that you can customize. By default, it knows how to create a specific kind of timer (DelayTimer), but you can teach it to create different kinds of timers if you need to.

This setup is useful because it allows other parts of the program to easily create timers without needing to know the exact details of how these timers are made. It's a way of making the code more flexible and easier to change in the future if needed.
