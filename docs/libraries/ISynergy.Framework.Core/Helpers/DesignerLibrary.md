# DesignerLibrary

The DesignerLibrary class is a helper class designed to detect the platform on which the code is running, specifically for design-time environments. Here's a simple explanation of what this code does:

- Purpose: The main purpose of this code is to identify which design-time platform the application is currently running on. This information can be useful for developers who need to write platform-specific code or handle different behaviors depending on the design environment.

- Inputs: This code doesn't take any direct inputs from the user. Instead, it relies on the system environment and available libraries to determine the platform.

- Outputs: The main output of this code is a DesignerPlatformLibrary enum value, which represents the detected platform (like .NET, WinRT, or Silverlight).

- How it works: The class uses a technique called lazy initialization to detect the platform. It only performs the detection once and then caches the result for future use. The actual detection happens in the GetCurrentPlatform method, which checks for the presence of specific types that are unique to different platforms.

- Logic flow: When the DetectedDesignerLibrary property is accessed for the first time, it calls the GetCurrentPlatform method. This method attempts to load certain types that are specific to different platforms. Based on which types are successfully loaded, it determines the current platform.

The code uses a private static field (_detectedDesignerPlatformLibrary) to store the result of the platform detection. This ensures that the potentially expensive detection process only happens once, and subsequent calls to DetectedDesignerLibrary simply return the cached result.

The GetCurrentPlatform method, although not fully shown in the provided code snippet, seems to check for .NET and WinRT platforms. It does this by attempting to load types that are specific to these platforms. If it can load a type from the PresentationFramework assembly, it assumes the platform is .NET. If it can load a type from the Windows Runtime, it assumes the platform is WinRT. If neither of these checks succeed, it likely returns an "Unknown" value.

This code is particularly useful in scenarios where developers need to write different code or use different libraries depending on the design-time environment they're working in. By providing an easy way to detect the current platform, it allows for more flexible and platform-specific code to be written.
