# InfoService.cs

This code defines a class called InfoService, which is designed to provide information about an application. The purpose of this class is to create a centralized place to store and access various details about the software, such as its version, company name, and product name.

The InfoService class doesn't take any direct inputs when it's created. Instead, it has methods that can be called later to set up the information it holds. It doesn't produce any direct outputs either, but it provides access to the information it stores through its properties.

One of the key features of this class is that it's designed to be used as a singleton, which means there's only one instance of it throughout the entire application. This is achieved through the static Default property, which uses a technique called double-checked locking to ensure that only one instance is created, even if multiple parts of the program try to access it at the same time.

The class has several properties that will hold information about the application, such as ProductVersion, ApplicationPath, CompanyName, ProductName, Copyrights, and Title. These properties are not set in the code shown, but there would likely be methods elsewhere in the class to set these values.

An important aspect of this class is that it's marked with the [Bindable] attribute. This suggests that it's designed to work with data binding, which is a way for the user interface of an application to automatically update when the data it's displaying changes.

The code also shows that this class implements an interface called IInfoService. This means that InfoService promises to provide certain methods or properties that are defined in the IInfoService interface, making it easier to use this class in other parts of the application.

Overall, this code sets up a structure for managing and accessing important information about an application in a centralized, easily accessible way. It's designed to be used throughout the application whenever details about the software itself are needed.
