# DefaultJsonSerializers.cs

This code defines a static class called DefaultJsonSerializers, which provides two methods for creating pre-configured JSON serialization options. The purpose of this code is to simplify the process of setting up JSON serialization in different contexts within an application.

The class doesn't take any direct inputs, but it provides two static methods: Default() and Web(). These methods don't require any parameters and can be called directly on the class.

Both methods return a JsonSerializerOptions object, which is used to configure how JSON serialization and deserialization should be performed. These options can then be used when converting objects to JSON strings or vice versa.

The Default() method creates a set of options suitable for general-purpose JSON serialization. It adds custom converters for handling enums, DateTime, DateTimeOffset, and TimeOnly types. It also configures the serializer to allow named floating-point literals, write indented JSON for better readability, and preserve object references.

The Web() method, on the other hand, creates a set of options optimized for web-based JSON serialization. It includes the same custom converters as the Default() method but adds more configuration options. For example, it allows trailing commas in JSON, uses camel case for property names, ignores read-only fields and properties, and allows reading numbers from strings.

The main difference in the logic flow between these two methods is that the Web() method applies more specific settings tailored for web scenarios, while the Default() method uses more general settings.

Both methods achieve their purpose by creating a new JsonSerializerOptions object and then configuring various properties on that object. The configuration includes adding custom converters, setting naming policies, and adjusting how certain types of data should be handled during serialization and deserialization.

In summary, this code provides a convenient way to get pre-configured JSON serialization options for different scenarios, saving developers time and ensuring consistent JSON handling across an application.
