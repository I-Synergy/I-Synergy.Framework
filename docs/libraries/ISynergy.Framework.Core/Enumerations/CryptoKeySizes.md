# CryptoKeySizes Enumeration

This code defines an enumeration called CryptoKeySizes, which is a list of predefined values representing different key sizes used in cryptography. The purpose of this enumeration is to provide a standardized way to refer to common key sizes in encryption algorithms.

The enumeration doesn't take any inputs or produce any outputs directly. Instead, it serves as a reference that can be used in other parts of the program when working with cryptographic operations.

The CryptoKeySizes enumeration contains five different key sizes:

- Key40: Represents a 40-bit key
- Key64: Represents a 64-bit key
- Key128: Represents a 128-bit key
- Key192: Represents a 192-bit key
- Key256: Represents a 256-bit key

Each of these enum members is assigned an integer value that corresponds to the actual number of bits in the key. For example, Key128 is assigned the value 128, which represents a 128-bit key.

The purpose of this enumeration is to make it easier for programmers to work with different key sizes in their cryptographic code. Instead of using raw numbers, which can be error-prone and less readable, they can use these named constants. This improves code readability and reduces the chance of mistakes when specifying key sizes.

For example, a programmer could use this enumeration in their code like this:

CryptoKeySizes selectedKeySize = CryptoKeySizes.Key256;


This clearly indicates that a 256-bit key is being used, which is more meaningful and less error-prone than writing the number 256 directly.

While this enumeration doesn't perform any operations or transformations on its own, it plays an important role in organizing and standardizing the way key sizes are represented in the broader cryptographic system of the application.
