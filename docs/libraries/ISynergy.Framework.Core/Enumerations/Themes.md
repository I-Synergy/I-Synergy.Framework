# Themes

The code in src\ISynergy.Framework.Core\Enumerations\Themes.cs defines an enumeration called "Themes" within the ISynergy.Framework.Core.Enumerations namespace.

The purpose of this code is to create a set of predefined constants that represent different theme options for a user interface. Enumerations are useful for creating a fixed set of named values that can be used throughout a program, making the code more readable and less prone to errors.

This enumeration doesn't take any inputs or produce any outputs directly. Instead, it defines a set of possible values that can be used elsewhere in the program when dealing with theme selection or theme-related functionality.

The Themes enumeration defines three possible values:

- Default (with a value of 0)
- Light (with a value of 1)
- Dark (with a value of 2)

Each of these values represents a different theme option. The Default theme likely represents the system's default appearance, while Light and Dark themes represent specific color schemes or visual styles.

The code achieves its purpose by using the enum keyword to create the Themes enumeration. Each theme option is listed as a separate member of the enum, with an assigned integer value. These values can be used in other parts of the program to represent or compare theme selections.

There isn't any complex logic or data transformation happening in this code. It's a simple declaration of the available theme options. However, this enumeration can be used in other parts of the program to control the appearance of the user interface, handle theme switching, or store user preferences.

By using an enumeration, the code ensures that only valid theme options can be used throughout the program. This helps prevent errors and makes the code more maintainable, as all theme-related choices are centralized in this one location.
