# ImageFormats Enum Explanation:

The ImageFormats enum, defined in the ISynergy.Framework.Core.Enumerations namespace, is a simple data structure that lists different types of image file formats. Its purpose is to provide a standardized way to refer to various image formats within a program.

This enum doesn't take any inputs or produce any outputs directly. Instead, it serves as a reference list that programmers can use when working with image-related functionality in their code.

The enum achieves its purpose by defining a set of named constants, each representing a specific image format. These constants include:

- bmp (Bitmap)
- gif (Graphics Interchange Format)
- jpg (Joint Photographic Experts Group)
- jpgXr (JPEG XR)
- tiff (Tagged Image File Format)
- heif (High Efficiency Image Format)

Each constant in the enum is accompanied by a summary comment that briefly describes the format it represents. This helps developers understand what each constant means without having to look up external documentation.

By using this enum, programmers can easily specify or identify image formats in their code. For example, they might use it when writing functions to save or load images, or when filtering files based on their format.

The ImageFormats enum doesn't contain any complex logic or data transformations. Its main value lies in providing a clear, standardized way to refer to different image formats within the codebase, which can help improve code readability and reduce errors that might occur from mistyping format names as strings.
