# Lifetimes Enumeration

This code defines an enumeration called "Lifetimes" within the namespace "ISynergy.Framework.Core.Enumerations". An enumeration is a special type in programming that allows you to define a set of named constants.

The purpose of this code is to create a simple way to represent and work with different types of lifetimes in a program, specifically "Scoped" and "Singleton". These terms are often used in the context of dependency injection and object management in software development.

This enumeration doesn't take any inputs or produce any outputs directly. Instead, it provides a way for other parts of the program to refer to these lifetime concepts using clear, meaningful names instead of arbitrary numbers.

The enumeration achieves its purpose by associating each lifetime concept with a specific integer value:

- Scoped is associated with the value 0
- Singleton is associated with the value 1

While the code itself doesn't perform any complex logic or data transformations, it sets up a structure that can be used throughout the program to make decisions or configure objects based on these lifetime concepts.

For example, other parts of the program might use this enumeration to determine how long an object should exist or how it should be shared between different parts of the application. A "Scoped" lifetime might indicate that an object should only exist for a short time or within a specific context, while a "Singleton" lifetime might suggest that only one instance of an object should exist throughout the entire application.

By defining these concepts as an enumeration, the code provides a standardized way to refer to these lifetimes, which can help make the overall program more organized and easier to understand, especially when dealing with object management and dependency injection scenarios.
