# NodeChangeTypes.cs

This code defines an enumeration called NodeChangeTypes, which is used to represent different types of changes that can occur to nodes in a data structure or system.

The purpose of this code is to provide a standardized way to describe what kind of change has happened to a node. It doesn't take any inputs or produce any outputs directly. Instead, it defines a set of named constants that can be used throughout a program to indicate specific node change events.

The enumeration contains two possible values:

- NodeAdded: This represents the event when a new node has been added to the structure.
- NodeRemoved: This represents the event when an existing node has been removed from the structure.

By using this enumeration, programmers can easily specify and identify the type of change that has occurred to a node. For example, when writing code that handles node changes, you could use these values to determine what action to take based on whether a node was added or removed.

The code achieves its purpose by using the C# enum keyword to create a named set of constants. Each constant (NodeAdded and NodeRemoved) is automatically assigned an integer value starting from 0, but these numeric values are typically not used directly. Instead, the named constants are used for their readability and type safety.

There's no complex logic or data transformation happening in this code. It's a simple definition that provides a clear, type-safe way to represent node change events in a program. This can help prevent errors and make code more understandable when dealing with operations that involve adding or removing nodes from a data structure.#
