# ApplicationInsightsOptions.cs

This code defines a simple class called ApplicationInsightsOptions within the namespace ISynergy.Framework.Logging.ApplicationInsights.Options. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to store and access a connection string for Application Insights, which is a monitoring and analytics service provided by Microsoft Azure.

The class doesn't take any direct inputs or produce any outputs on its own. Instead, it serves as a container for a single piece of information: the connection string. This is achieved through a property called ConnectionString, which can be both read from and written to (indicated by the get; set; accessors).

The main purpose of this class is to encapsulate the connection string information, making it easy to pass around and use in other parts of the application that need to interact with Application Insights. By using a dedicated class for this purpose, the code becomes more organized and easier to maintain.

There isn't any complex logic or data transformation happening within this class. It's a straightforward data container, often referred to as a POCO (Plain Old CLR Object) in C# terminology. The class can be instantiated and its ConnectionString property can be set with the appropriate value when needed.

For example, other parts of the application might use this class to configure the connection to Application Insights, like this:

var options = new ApplicationInsightsOptions();
options.ConnectionString = "Your-Connection-String-Here";

This approach allows for a clean separation of configuration data from the code that uses it, which is a good practice in software development. It makes the application more flexible and easier to configure without changing the core code.
