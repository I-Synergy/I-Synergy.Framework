# DefaultTelemetryInitializer

This code defines a class called DefaultTelemetryInitializer, which is responsible for initializing telemetry data in an application that uses Microsoft Application Insights for logging and monitoring.

The purpose of this code is to add default properties to different types of telemetry data before it's sent to Application Insights. This helps in enriching the telemetry data with additional context, making it more informative and useful for analysis.

The class takes two inputs through its constructor: an IContext object and an IInfoService object. These are likely used to provide additional information about the application's context and to retrieve various pieces of information, respectively.

While the code doesn't produce a direct output, it modifies the telemetry object that's passed to the Initialize method. This method is the main entry point for the class's functionality.

The Initialize method achieves its purpose by checking the type of the incoming telemetry object and then adding default properties to it. It does this by calling the AddDefaultProperties method (which is not shown in this code snippet, but is likely defined in an extension method) on the Properties collection of each telemetry type.

The code handles several types of telemetry, including RequestTelemetry, ExceptionTelemetry, DependencyTelemetry, EventTelemetry, MetricTelemetry, TraceTelemetry, and PageViewTelemetry. For each type, it adds the default properties using the same pattern.

An important logic flow in this code is the series of if statements that check the type of the telemetry object. This allows the code to handle different types of telemetry appropriately, ensuring that the right properties are added to each type.

Overall, this code serves as a central place to enrich all outgoing telemetry data with consistent, default information, which can be very useful for debugging, monitoring, and analyzing application behavior and performance.
