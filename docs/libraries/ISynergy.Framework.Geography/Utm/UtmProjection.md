# UtmProjection

The UtmProjection class is part of a geography-related framework and represents the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection system. This class is designed to handle geographic coordinate conversions and calculations specific to the UTM projection.

The purpose of this code is to provide a foundation for working with UTM projections in geographic applications. It allows users to create UTM projection objects, either with a default reference ellipsoid (WGS84) or a custom one.

The class takes two types of inputs:

- No input (default constructor)
- A reference ellipsoid (custom constructor)

While the code snippet doesn't show specific outputs, the class is set up to perform various UTM-related calculations and conversions, which would typically produce coordinate data or other geographic information.

The class achieves its purpose by inheriting from a more general MercatorProjection class and adding UTM-specific functionality. It initializes mathematical constants based on the reference ellipsoid, which are crucial for UTM calculations.

The code defines two constructors:

- A parameterless constructor that uses the WGS84 ellipsoid as a default reference.
- A constructor that accepts a custom reference ellipsoid.

Both constructors ultimately call the base class constructor and initialize a MathConsts object with the chosen ellipsoid. This MathConsts object likely contains pre-calculated values used in UTM formulas.

The class also defines properties for the minimum and maximum latitudes that can be represented in the UTM projection. These limits are set to -80 degrees and 84 degrees, respectively, which is a standard range for UTM projections.

While the shared code doesn't show the implementation of specific UTM calculations, it sets up the framework for these operations. The use of a custom MathConsts object suggests that the class is prepared to handle complex mathematical transformations required for UTM projections.

In summary, this UtmProjection class provides a specialized tool for working with geographic coordinates in the UTM system, allowing for flexibility in the choice of reference ellipsoid and setting up the necessary components for UTM-specific calculations.
