# GeodeticCurve.cs

This code defines a structure called GeodeticCurve, which represents the result of a geodetic calculation. In simple terms, it describes the path and distance between two points on the Earth's surface, taking into account the Earth's ellipsoidal shape.

The purpose of this code is to provide a way to store and access information about a geodetic curve. It doesn't take any direct inputs or produce any outputs on its own. Instead, it serves as a container for data that would be calculated elsewhere in the program.

The GeodeticCurve structure contains three main pieces of information:

- EllipsoidalDistance: This is the distance between two points along the curve, measured in meters.
- Calculator: This is a reference to the GeodeticCalculator object that was used to compute this curve.
- Azimuth: This represents the angle from north to the direction of the curve at its starting point.

These properties are all read-only, which means they can only be set when the GeodeticCurve is created and cannot be changed afterwards.

The structure implements the IEquatable interface, which suggests that it will provide a way to compare two GeodeticCurve objects for equality. However, the implementation of this comparison is not shown in the provided code snippet.

While this code doesn't perform any calculations or transformations itself, it plays an important role in organizing and storing the results of geodetic calculations. It provides a structured way to keep related pieces of information together, making it easier for other parts of the program to work with the results of these complex calculations.

The use of a struct instead of a class suggests that GeodeticCurve is intended to be a lightweight, value-type object. This can be beneficial for performance in certain scenarios, especially if many GeodeticCurve objects are created and manipulated in the program.

Overall, this code sets up a foundation for working with geodetic calculations in a structured and organized manner, which would be particularly useful in applications dealing with geography, mapping, or navigation.
