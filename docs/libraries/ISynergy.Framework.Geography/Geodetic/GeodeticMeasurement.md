# GeodeticMeasurement.cs

This code defines a struct called GeodeticMeasurement, which is designed to represent the result of a three-dimensional geodetic calculation. In simple terms, it's used to describe the path between two points on the Earth's surface, taking into account the Earth's shape and elevation changes.

The purpose of this code is to provide a structured way to store and access various measurements related to the path between two global positions. It doesn't take any direct inputs or produce outputs on its own, but rather serves as a container for storing calculated values.

The struct contains several properties that represent different aspects of the geodetic measurement:

- Calculator: This property returns the GeodeticCalculator used to compute the measurement. It's accessed through the AverageCurve property.

- AverageCurve: This represents the geodetic curve measured at the average elevation between two points. It's a key component of the measurement.

- EllipsoidalDistance: This property returns the distance along the Earth's surface between the two points, measured in meters. It's calculated based on the AverageCurve.

These properties allow users of the struct to easily access different aspects of the geodetic measurement without having to perform complex calculations themselves. The struct acts as a convenient package of related information about the path between two points on the Earth's surface.

The code achieves its purpose by defining these properties and their relationships. It uses the concept of a geodetic curve (represented by the AverageCurve property) as the basis for other calculations. For example, the EllipsoidalDistance is derived directly from the AverageCurve.

While this excerpt doesn't show the full implementation, it sets up the structure for storing and accessing geodetic measurements. This can be useful in various applications, such as navigation systems, mapping software, or any program that needs to work with distances and paths on the Earth's surface.
