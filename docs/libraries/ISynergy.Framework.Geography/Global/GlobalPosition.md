# GlobalPosition

The GlobalPosition struct is designed to represent a three-dimensional location on a globe. It combines geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) with an elevation above a reference ellipsoid (an approximation of the Earth's surface). This struct is part of a geography-related framework and is intended to provide a way to work with precise locations on Earth.

The struct takes two main inputs: GlobalCoordinates (which likely contains latitude and longitude) and an elevation value in meters. It doesn't produce any direct outputs, but instead encapsulates this data for use in other parts of the program.

The purpose of this code is to create a data structure that can accurately represent a position anywhere on or above the Earth's surface. This is useful for various applications such as mapping, navigation, or any system that needs to work with geographical data.

The struct achieves its purpose by storing the coordinates and elevation as properties. It provides two constructors: one that takes both coordinates and elevation, and another that only takes coordinates (assuming the position is on the surface with zero elevation).

An important aspect of this struct is its precision. It defines a very small number (0.000000000001 or 10^-12) as a constant called Precision. This suggests that the struct is designed to handle very precise measurements, which is crucial for accurate geographical calculations.

The struct also implements two interfaces: IComparable and IEquatable. This means that instances of GlobalPosition can be compared and checked for equality, which is important for sorting or finding specific positions.

While the shared code doesn't show the full implementation of these interfaces, it sets up the structure for comparing positions based on their coordinates and elevations. This would allow users of this struct to easily sort or search for specific positions in a collection.

In summary, the GlobalPosition struct provides a way to represent and work with precise three-dimensional locations on Earth, combining geographical coordinates with elevation data. It's designed to be used in a larger system for handling geographical information and calculations.
