# GlobalMercatorProjection Class

This code defines an abstract class called GlobalMercatorProjection, which is designed to handle Mercator projections for mapping the entire globe. Mercator projections are a way of representing the spherical Earth on a flat surface, like a map.

The purpose of this class is to provide a foundation for different types of global Mercator projections. It includes methods for calculating scale factors and converting between geographic coordinates and map coordinates.

The class takes an Ellipsoid object as input when it's created. This Ellipsoid represents the shape of the Earth used for calculations. The Earth isn't a perfect sphere, so using an ellipsoid model helps make the projections more accurate.

The main output of this class is the ability to convert between different coordinate systems and calculate scale factors. These are crucial for creating accurate maps and performing geographic calculations.

One of the key methods in this class is the ScaleFactor method. It takes a latitude as input and calculates the Mercator scale factor for that latitude. The scale factor is important because Mercator projections distort the size of areas as you move away from the equator. This method helps account for that distortion.

The ScaleFactor method works by first converting the input latitude from degrees to radians. Then it uses a mathematical formula involving trigonometric functions (sine and cosine) and the eccentricity of the reference ellipsoid to calculate the scale factor. This calculation is a bit complex, but essentially it's determining how much the map needs to be "stretched" at that particular latitude to maintain accurate angles on the map.

While this class provides some concrete implementations, it's marked as abstract, meaning it's intended to be inherited by other classes that will provide more specific implementations for different types of global Mercator projections. This allows for flexibility in how different projections might handle certain calculations or conversions.

Overall, this class serves as a crucial building block for creating and working with global maps using Mercator projections. It provides the basic structure and some common calculations that any global Mercator projection would need, while leaving room for specific variations to be implemented in child classes.
