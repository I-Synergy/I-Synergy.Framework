# NumericState.cs

This code defines three classes: IntegerState, DecimalState, and DoubleState. These classes are designed to represent numeric states or triggers based on different numeric types (integer, decimal, and double). The purpose of this code is to provide a way to create and manage numeric states within an automation framework.

Each class takes three inputs when creating a new instance:

- "from": The starting value of the numeric range
- "to": The ending value of the numeric range
- "for": A TimeSpan value representing a duration

The code doesn't produce any direct outputs. Instead, these classes are meant to be used as part of a larger automation system, where they likely help define conditions or triggers based on numeric values.

The classes achieve their purpose by inheriting from a base class called BaseState, where T is the specific numeric type (int, decimal, or double). This inheritance allows each class to use the functionality provided by the base class while specifying the exact numeric type it works with.

The main logic in these classes is quite simple. Each class has a constructor that takes the three input parameters (from, to, and for) and passes them to the base class constructor using the ": base(from, to, for)" syntax. This means that most of the actual functionality is probably implemented in the BaseState class, which is not shown in this code snippet.

The important aspect of this code is that it provides a consistent way to create numeric states for different types of numbers. This allows the automation framework to handle various numeric scenarios (whole numbers, decimal numbers, or floating-point numbers) using a similar structure.

For example, if you wanted to create a trigger that activates when an integer value is between 5 and 10 for 30 seconds, you could use the IntegerState class. Similarly, if you needed a trigger for a decimal value between 0.5 and 1.5 for 1 minute, you'd use the DecimalState class.

Overall, this code sets up a foundation for working with numeric states in an automation system, allowing for flexible and type-specific handling of different numeric ranges and durations.
