# EventState.cs

This code defines a class called EventState, which is designed to represent and manage the state of an event in an automation system. The purpose of this class is to encapsulate information about a specific event, including its unique identifier, duration, and associated data.

The EventState class doesn't take any direct inputs when it's created. Instead, it uses a constructor that requires three parameters: an EventInfo object (which represents information about the event), an object containing event data, and a TimeSpan value indicating how long the event should last.

As for outputs, this class doesn't produce any direct outputs. Instead, it stores and manages data that can be accessed and used by other parts of the automation system.

The class achieves its purpose by using properties to store and manage different pieces of information related to the event state. These properties include:

- StateId: A unique identifier for the event state.
- For: The duration for which the event state should be active.
- Event: Information about the event itself.
- EventData: Any additional data associated with the event.

The class uses a base class called ObservableClass and implements an interface called IState. This suggests that the class is designed to work within a larger system that can observe and react to changes in the event state.

An important aspect of this class is how it manages its data. Instead of using simple fields, it uses getter and setter methods (GetValue and SetValue) to access and modify its properties. This approach allows for more control over how the data is accessed and modified, and it may enable features like change notification or validation.

The constructor of the class is responsible for initializing the event state. It generates a new unique identifier (StateId), sets the duration (For), and stores the event information and data. It also includes some basic validation to ensure that the event and duration parameters are not null.

In summary, the EventState class provides a structured way to represent and manage event states in an automation system. It encapsulates all the necessary information about an event and provides a consistent interface for accessing and modifying this information. This class would likely be used as part of a larger system that tracks and responds to various events over time.
