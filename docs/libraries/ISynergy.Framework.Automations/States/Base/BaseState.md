# BaseState.cs

This code defines an abstract class called BaseState, which serves as a foundation for creating different states in an automation system. The purpose of this class is to provide a common structure and basic functionality that all specific states can inherit and build upon.

The BaseState class doesn't take any direct inputs when it's created, but it does have a constructor that requires a TimeSpan parameter called "for". This parameter is used to set how long the state should hold before triggering an action.

As for outputs, the class doesn't produce any direct outputs. Instead, it provides properties that can be accessed and modified by other parts of the program that use this class.

The class achieves its purpose by defining several properties that are common to all states:

- StateId: A unique identifier for each state instance.
- For: The duration for which the state should hold.
- Entity: Represents the object or entity associated with this state.
- Attribute: Represents a specific attribute of the entity.

These properties are implemented using a getter and setter pattern, which allows for controlled access and modification of the values. The class inherits from ObservableClass, which likely provides functionality to notify observers when these properties change.

An important aspect of this class is that it's abstract, meaning it can't be instantiated directly. Instead, it's meant to be inherited by other, more specific state classes. These child classes would then add their own unique properties and methods on top of what BaseState provides.

The constructor of BaseState generates a new Guid (globally unique identifier) for the StateId and sets the For property to the provided TimeSpan value. This ensures that each state instance has a unique identifier and a specified duration.

In simple terms, you can think of BaseState as a template for creating different types of states in an automation system. It provides the basic structure and common properties that all states should have, making it easier to create and manage various states in a consistent way.
