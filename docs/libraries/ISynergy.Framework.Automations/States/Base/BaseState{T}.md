# BaseState.cs

This code defines a generic abstract class called BaseState which serves as a foundation for creating state objects in an automation framework. The purpose of this class is to provide a reusable structure for representing a state transition from one value to another, with an associated duration.

The class takes three inputs: a "from" value, a "to" value (both of type T), and a duration (as a TimeSpan). These inputs are provided through the constructor when creating an instance of a class that inherits from BaseState.

While this class doesn't produce direct outputs, it provides properties (From and To) that can be accessed to retrieve the state transition values. These properties use generic methods (GetValue and SetValue) to handle the storage and retrieval of values, allowing flexibility in the types of data that can be used for the state transition.

The class achieves its purpose by:

- Inheriting from a non-generic BaseState class, which likely handles common functionality for all states.
- Implementing the IState interface, ensuring that any class derived from BaseState will have the necessary properties and methods for state management.
- Providing properties (From and To) to store and retrieve the state transition values.
- Using a constructor to initialize the state with the      provided values, including a duration passed to the base class.

An important aspect of the logic is the use of the Argument.IsNotNull() method in the constructor. This ensures that neither the "from" nor "to" values are null, adding a layer of input validation to prevent potential errors.

The class doesn't contain complex algorithms or data transformations. Instead, it focuses on providing a structured way to represent a state transition. This structure can be used as a building block for more complex automation scenarios where you need to track changes in state over time.

In summary, BaseState is a flexible, reusable class that allows developers to create state objects with type-safe "from" and "to" values, along with a duration. It's designed to be extended by other classes that need to represent specific types of state transitions in an automation system.
