# BaseNumericState.cs

This code defines an abstract class called BaseNumericState which serves as a foundation for creating numeric states in an automation framework. The purpose of this class is to provide a reusable structure for handling numeric values with upper and lower bounds.

The class takes a generic type parameter T, which must be a struct (a value type). This allows the class to work with different numeric types like int, float, or double. The class inherits from a BaseState class, suggesting it's part of a larger state management system.

The main inputs for this class are two values of type T: 'below' and 'above'. These are set through the constructor and represent the lower and upper bounds of the numeric state, respectively. The class doesn't produce any direct outputs, but it provides properties to access and modify these bounds.

The class achieves its purpose by:

- Defining two properties, Below and Above, which use generic getter and setter methods (GetValue() and SetValue()) to manage the state values. These methods are likely defined in the base class.

- Implementing a constructor that takes 'below' and 'above' parameters and initializes the state with these values. The constructor also calls the base class constructor with a TimeSpan.Zero parameter, which might be related to timing or duration in the state system.

- Using argument validation (Argument.IsNotNull()) to ensure that the 'below' and 'above' values provided are not null. This helps maintain the integrity of the state.

The important logic in this class revolves around the management of the numeric bounds. While we don't see the implementation details of GetValue() and SetValue(), these methods likely handle the storage and retrieval of the state values in a type-safe manner.

This class serves as a building block for more specific numeric states. By inheriting from BaseNumericState, other classes can easily implement states that need to track values within a certain range, such as temperature sensors, speed monitors, or any other numeric-based state in an automation system.
