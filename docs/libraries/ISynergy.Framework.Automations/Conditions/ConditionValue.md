# ConditionValue

The ConditionValue class in src\ISynergy.Framework.Automations\Conditions\ConditionValue.cs is designed to hold and categorize values used in conditions for an automation system. This class serves as a wrapper for different types of values, associating them with specific state types.

The main purpose of this code is to create a flexible container for various data types, which can be used in conditional logic within an automation framework. It takes in a value of any type and determines the appropriate state type based on the value's data type.

The class has two main properties: State and Value. The State property holds the type of state associated with the value, while the Value property holds the actual value itself. These properties allow the automation system to understand both what kind of data it's dealing with and what the specific value is.

The class has two constructors. The first constructor takes a single parameter 'value' of type object. This allows it to accept any type of value. Based on the type of this input value, the constructor uses a switch statement to determine the appropriate State type. For example, if the input is an integer, it sets the State to IntegerState. If it's a boolean, it sets the State to BooleanState, and so on. If the input doesn't match any of the specific cases, it defaults to StringState. After determining the State, it stores the original value in the Value property.

The second constructor is specifically for handling events. It takes two parameters: an event name (as a string) and a value (as an object). This constructor always sets the State to EventState and stores the provided value in the Value property.

The important logic flow in this code is the type checking and state assignment in the first constructor. This allows the class to categorize different types of data automatically, which can be useful for processing conditions in an automation system.

In summary, the ConditionValue class provides a way to package different types of values along with information about what type of state they represent. This can be particularly useful in automation scenarios where different types of data need to be handled in a uniform way, while still retaining information about their original type.
