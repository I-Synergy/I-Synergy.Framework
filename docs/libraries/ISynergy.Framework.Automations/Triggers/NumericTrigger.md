# NumericTrigger.cs

This code defines three classes: IntegerTrigger, DecimalTrigger, and DoubleTrigger. These classes are designed to create triggers for numeric values in an automation system. The purpose of these triggers is to monitor specific numeric properties and execute a callback function when the value goes above or below certain thresholds.

Each trigger class is specialized for a different numeric type: integers, decimals, and doubles. They all inherit from a base class called BaseNumericTrigger, which likely contains the core functionality for monitoring and triggering based on numeric values.

The input for each trigger consists of several parameters:

- An automationId (a unique identifier for the automation)
- A function that returns an entity and a property to monitor
- A "below" threshold value
- An "above" threshold value
- A callback function to execute when the trigger conditions are met

The output of these triggers is not directly visible in this code, but they are designed to execute the provided callback function when the monitored value crosses the specified thresholds.

The triggers achieve their purpose by setting up a monitoring system for the specified numeric property. When the value of that property changes, the trigger checks if it has gone above the "above" threshold or below the "below" threshold. If either of these conditions is met, the callback function is called with the current value as its argument.

The important logic flow in this code is the setup of these triggers. When a trigger is created, it establishes a connection to the property it needs to monitor and sets up the conditions for when to execute the callback. This allows for automated responses to changes in numeric values within the system.

While the actual monitoring and triggering logic is not visible in this specific code snippet (it's likely implemented in the BaseNumericTrigger class), these classes provide a clean and type-safe way to create triggers for different types of numeric values. This approach allows the system to handle integers, decimals, and doubles in a consistent manner while still maintaining type safety and specificity where needed.
