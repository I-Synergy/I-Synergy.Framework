# TimeTrigger.cs

This code defines a class called TimeTrigger, which is designed to represent a time-based trigger for automations. The purpose of this code is to create a structure that can be used to schedule automated tasks or actions at specific times.

The TimeTrigger class takes three inputs when it's created:

- automationId: A unique identifier (Guid) for the automation associated with this trigger.
- at: A TimeSpan value representing the time at which the trigger should activate.
- isFixedTime: A boolean value indicating whether the trigger time is fixed or relative.

The class doesn't produce any direct outputs, but it stores and manages the input information. This stored information can be used by other parts of the automation system to determine when to execute certain actions.

The TimeTrigger class achieves its purpose by extending a base class called BaseTrigger and adding two properties specific to time-based triggers:

- At: This property stores the time at which the trigger should activate. It's represented as a TimeSpan, which allows for flexible time specifications.

- IsFixedTime: This boolean property indicates whether the stored time is a fixed time of day (like 3:00 PM) or a relative time (like 2 hours from now).

The class uses a simple getter and setter pattern for these properties, likely relying on methods (GetValue and SetValue) defined in the base class to handle the actual storage and retrieval of values.

The constructor of the TimeTrigger class takes the three input parameters mentioned earlier. It calls the base class constructor with the automationId, then sets the At and IsFixedTime properties using the provided values. There's also a check (Argument.IsNotNull(at)) to ensure that the 'at' parameter is not null, which helps prevent invalid trigger configurations.

While this code doesn't include complex algorithms or data transformations, it plays an important role in structuring time-based automation triggers. It provides a clear and organized way to store the necessary information for scheduling automated tasks, which can be used by other parts of the automation system to execute actions at the right time.
