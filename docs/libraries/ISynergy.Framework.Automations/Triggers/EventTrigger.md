# EventTrigger.cs

This code defines a class called EventTrigger, which is designed to create a trigger mechanism based on events in a software automation system. The purpose of this code is to allow developers to set up automated actions that occur when specific events happen in their program.

The EventTrigger class takes several inputs when it's created:

- An automationId (a unique identifier for the automation)
- An entity of type T (which can be any type of object)
- A subscription action (which is used to subscribe to an event)
- A callback function (which is called when the event occurs)

The class doesn't produce any direct outputs. Instead, it sets up a system where when a specific event occurs, a predefined action (the callback function) is automatically executed.

The class achieves its purpose by using the subscription action to hook into an event. When that event is triggered, it automatically calls the provided callback function, passing the entity as a parameter. This creates a chain reaction: event occurs → trigger activates → callback function runs.

An important aspect of the logic flow is that the callback function is executed asynchronously (it returns a Task), but the code uses .Wait() to make it synchronous within the event handler. This ensures that the callback completes before the event handler finishes.

The class also includes some basic error checking. It uses Argument.IsNotNull(entity) to make sure that the entity parameter isn't null, which helps prevent errors later on.

In simple terms, you can think of this class as setting up a listener for a specific event. When that event happens, it automatically performs a task you've defined. It's like telling your program, "When X happens, do Y," where X is the event and Y is your callback function.

This kind of trigger system is useful in many types of applications, especially those that need to react to user actions or system events in real-time. It allows for more dynamic and responsive programs that can automatically perform actions based on what's happening in the system.
