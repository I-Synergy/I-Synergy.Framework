# BaseTrigger.cs

BaseTrigger.cs is a C# class that serves as a base for creating triggers in an automation framework. Here's a simple explanation of what this code does:

The purpose of this code is to provide a foundation for creating triggers that can monitor changes in values and execute actions when specific conditions are met. It's designed to be flexible and work with different types of data, which is why it uses a generic type T.

This class doesn't take direct inputs in the traditional sense. Instead, it's meant to be inherited by other classes that will use its functionality. It does, however, require several parameters when creating an instance, including an automation ID, a function to observe, 'from' and 'to' values, a callback function, and a time span.

The class doesn't produce direct outputs either. Its main job is to set up the structure for triggers and provide properties that can be used by derived classes.

The BaseTrigger class achieves its purpose by defining two main properties: 'From' and 'To'. These properties represent the starting and ending values that the trigger is watching for. It also includes a constructor that sets up the basic information needed for a trigger, such as the automation ID, the values to watch for, and how long to watch (the 'For' property).

An important aspect of this class is that it includes some basic validation in its constructor. It checks that the 'from' and 'to' values are not null and that they are equal to each other. It also ensures that the time span ('for') is not null. This helps prevent errors when setting up triggers.

The class is designed to work with observable properties, which means it can watch for changes in values over time. However, the actual implementation of this observation is commented out in the constructor. If uncommented, it would set up a system to listen for property changes and execute a callback function when the value changes from the 'From' value to the 'To' value.

In summary, this code provides a structure for creating triggers in an automation system. It sets up the basic properties and validation needed for a trigger, but leaves the specific implementation details to be filled in by classes that inherit from it. This allows for flexibility in creating different types of triggers while ensuring they all have a common base structure.
