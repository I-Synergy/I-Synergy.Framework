# BaseNumericTrigger.cs

This code defines a base class called BaseNumericTrigger that serves as a foundation for creating numeric triggers in an automation system. The purpose of this class is to provide a reusable structure for triggers that work with numeric values of a generic type T.

The class takes several inputs through its constructors:

- An automationId (a unique identifier for the automation)
- A "below" value of type T
- An "above" value of type T
- A TimeSpan value called "for"
- Optionally, a function that returns an entity and a property, and a callback function

The main outputs of this class are the "Below" and "Above" properties, which can be get and set. These properties represent the lower and upper bounds of the trigger's activation range.

The class achieves its purpose by providing a structure that other, more specific numeric triggers can inherit from and build upon. It sets up the basic properties and constructor logic that all numeric triggers are likely to need.

The important logic in this class includes:

- The use of generic type T, which allows the trigger to work with different numeric types (like int, double, etc.) as long as they are structs.
- The constructor that takes the basic parameters (automationId, below, above, for) and sets up the trigger's properties.
- A more complex constructor that takes a function and a callback, which seems to be set up for responding to property changes, although this functionality is currently commented out.

The class uses argument validation to ensure that the "below", "above", and "for" parameters are not null when the trigger is created. This helps prevent errors that could occur if these important values were missing.

While the class doesn't implement the actual triggering logic (that's left for derived classes to do), it provides the framework for creating such logic. The commented-out code in the second constructor suggests that it was intended to set up an event listener for property changes and trigger the callback when the value falls within the specified range.

In summary, this class serves as a starting point for creating more specific numeric triggers, providing the basic structure and properties that such triggers would need. It's designed to be flexible (through the use of generics) and to enforce some basic rules (through argument validation) to ensure that triggers created from this base class have the necessary information to function
