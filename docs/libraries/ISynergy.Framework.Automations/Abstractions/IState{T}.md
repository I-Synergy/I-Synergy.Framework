# IState.cs

This code defines an interface called IState in the ISynergy.Framework.Automations.Abstractions namespace. An interface in programming is like a contract that describes what methods and properties a class should have, without actually implementing them.

The purpose of this interface is to represent a state in a system that can change from one value to another. It's designed to be flexible, allowing different types of states to be represented using the generic type parameter T.

This interface doesn't take any inputs directly or produce any outputs. Instead, it defines a structure that classes implementing this interface must follow. It specifies two properties that such classes should have: From and To.

The From property represents the starting state, while the To property represents the ending state. Both of these properties are of type T, which means they can be of any data type (like numbers, strings, or custom objects) depending on how the interface is used.

By using this interface, programmers can create classes that represent different kinds of state transitions in their applications. For example, if T is an integer, it could represent a numerical state changing from one number to another. If T is a string, it could represent a status changing from one text description to another.

The interface also inherits from another interface called IState (without the generic type parameter). This suggests that there might be some common functionality or properties defined in IState that all state objects should have, regardless of their specific type.

Overall, this code provides a flexible structure for representing state changes in a system, allowing developers to create consistent state objects across their application while adapting to different types of state data.
