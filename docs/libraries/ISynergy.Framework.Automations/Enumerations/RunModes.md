# RunModes Enumeration

This code defines an enumeration called RunModes in the ISynergy.Framework.Automations.Enumerations namespace. An enumeration is a special type in programming that allows you to define a set of named constants. In this case, RunModes is used to represent different modes of running an automation task.

The purpose of this code is to provide a clear and standardized way to specify how an automation task should be executed. It doesn't take any inputs or produce any outputs directly. Instead, it defines a set of options that can be used elsewhere in the program to control the behavior of automation tasks.

The RunModes enumeration includes four different options:

- Single: This mode indicates that the automation task should run only once as a single instance.
- Restart: In this mode, the automation task will restart after it finishes its current task.
- Queued: This mode suggests that the automation task will be placed in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue, meaning it will wait its turn to be executed.
- Parallel: This mode indicates that the automation task can 
run simultaneously with other tasks.

By defining these options as an enumeration, the code provides a convenient way for other parts of the program to specify and work with different run modes. For example, a function that starts an automation task might accept a RunModes parameter to determine how the task should be executed.

The code achieves its purpose simply by declaring the enumeration and its members. There's no complex logic or algorithm involved. The importance lies in the clear definition of these run modes, which can be used to control the flow and behavior of automation tasks in the larger application.

This enumeration is particularly useful for beginners as it demonstrates how to create a simple, yet powerful tool for organizing and controlling program behavior. It shows how enumerations can be used to create a set of named options that make code more readable and maintainable.
