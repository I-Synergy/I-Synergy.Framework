# RepeatTypes.cs

This code defines an enumeration called RepeatTypes, which is used to specify different types of repetition in a program. Enumerations are a way to create a set of named constants, making it easier to work with a fixed set of values.

The purpose of this code is to provide two distinct options for how a repetition or loop should behave in an automation framework. These options are "While" and "Until", which represent two common ways of controlling repetitive actions in programming.

This enumeration doesn't take any inputs or produce any outputs directly. Instead, it defines a type that can be used elsewhere in the program to control the flow of repetitive tasks.

The RepeatTypes enum achieves its purpose by simply declaring two possible values:

- "While": This option suggests that an action should repeat as long as a certain condition remains true.
- "Until": This option indicates that an action should 
repeat until a specific condition becomes true.

By providing these two options, the code allows other parts of the program to easily specify and differentiate between these two types of repetition logic. For example, a function that implements a loop could accept a RepeatTypes parameter to determine whether it should continue "while" a condition is true or "until" a condition becomes true.

The logic flow in this code is straightforward. When used in other parts of the program, developers can refer to these enum values (RepeatTypes.While or RepeatTypes.Until) to control how repetitive actions are performed. This makes the code more readable and helps prevent errors that might occur if developers had to use less descriptive values like numbers or strings to represent these concepts.

In summary, this RepeatTypes enumeration provides a clear and type-safe way to represent two fundamental types of repetition in programming, which can be used throughout the automation framework to control how tasks are repeated.
