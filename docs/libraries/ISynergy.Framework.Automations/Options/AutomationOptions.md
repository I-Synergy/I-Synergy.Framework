# AutomationOptions.cs

This code defines a class called AutomationOptions, which is designed to store configuration settings for an automation system. The purpose of this class is to provide a structured way to manage and access various timing-related options that control the behavior of automated processes.

The AutomationOptions class doesn't take any direct inputs or produce any outputs. Instead, it serves as a container for three important time-related properties:

- DefaultTimeout: This property represents the default amount of time an automated process should wait before timing out or giving up on an operation.

- DefaultRefreshRate: This property defines how often the automation system should check for updates or refresh its state.

- DefaultQueueRefreshRate: This property specifies how frequently the system should check or update a queue of automated tasks.

Each of these properties is of type TimeSpan, which is a built-in C# type used to represent a period of time. By using TimeSpan, the class allows for precise control over these timing settings, which can be set in terms of hours, minutes, seconds, or even milliseconds.

The class achieves its purpose by providing a simple structure to hold these configuration options. It uses C# properties, which allow other parts of the program to easily get or set these values. This design makes it convenient for other components of the automation system to access and modify these settings as needed.

While there's no complex logic or data transformation happening within this class itself, it plays a crucial role in the larger automation framework. By centralizing these timing options, it helps ensure consistent behavior across different parts of the system and makes it easier to adjust these settings globally if needed.

In summary, the AutomationOptions class is a straightforward but important component in an automation framework, providing a clean and organized way to manage key timing settings that control the overall behavior of automated processes.
