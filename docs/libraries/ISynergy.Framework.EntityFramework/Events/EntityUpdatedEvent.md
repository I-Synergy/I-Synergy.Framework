# EntityUpdatedEvent.cs

This code defines a class called EntityUpdatedEvent<T> which is designed to represent an event that occurs when an entity is updated in a system. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to package and pass information about an updated entity to other parts of the program that might need to react to or process this update.

The class takes a single input, which is an entity of type T. This entity must be a subclass of BaseEntity, as specified by the constraint where T : BaseEntity. This input is provided through the constructor of the class when a new instance of EntityUpdatedEvent<T> is created.

The output of this class is essentially the entity itself, which can be accessed through the Entity property. This property is read-only (it only has a getter), meaning that once the event is created, the entity it contains cannot be changed.

The class achieves its purpose by simply storing the provided entity and making it available through a property. There isn't any complex logic or algorithm involved. It's a straightforward container for holding and passing along an updated entity.

The main data flow in this class is the passing of the entity from the constructor to the Entity property. When an instance of EntityUpdatedEvent<T> is created, the entity is stored, and it can then be accessed by any code that receives this event object.

This class is part of a larger event system, likely used in an application that follows the Entity Framework pattern. It allows other parts of the program to be notified when an entity has been updated, and provides them with access to the updated entity. This can be useful for tasks like updating user interfaces, synchronizing data, or triggering other processes that need to occur when an entity changes.
