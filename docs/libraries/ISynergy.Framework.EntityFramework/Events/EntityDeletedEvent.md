# EntityDeletedEvent.cs

This code defines a class called EntityDeletedEvent<T> which is designed to handle events related to entity deletion in a database or data management system. The purpose of this class is to create a container that holds information about an entity that has been deleted from the system.

The class takes a generic type parameter T, which must be a type that inherits from BaseEntity. This allows the class to work with different types of entities in the system, as long as they are based on the BaseEntity class.

The main input for this class is the entity that has been deleted. This is passed to the constructor of the class when a new instance is created. The constructor takes a single parameter of type T, which represents the deleted entity.

The output of this class is essentially the entity itself, which can be accessed through the Entity property. This property is read-only, meaning that once the EntityDeletedEvent is created, the entity it contains cannot be changed.

The class achieves its purpose by simply storing the deleted entity and providing access to it. It doesn't perform any complex logic or data transformations. Instead, it serves as a way to package information about a deleted entity so that other parts of the system can react to or process the deletion event.

The importance of this class lies in its role within an event-driven architecture. When an entity is deleted from the system, an instance of EntityDeletedEvent<T> can be created and passed to event handlers or other parts of the application that need to know about or respond to entity deletions. This allows for loose coupling between different parts of the system and enables more flexible and maintainable code.

It's worth noting that this class is specifically for entities that are actually removed from the system, not for entities that are marked as deleted through a boolean flag or similar mechanism (often called "soft delete"). This distinction is important for understanding how the class should be used in the broader context of the application.
