# EntityInsertedEvent.cs

This code defines a class called EntityInsertedEvent<T> which is designed to represent an event that occurs when a new entity is inserted into a database or data store. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to notify other parts of the application that a new entity has been added, allowing them to react or perform additional actions if needed.

The class takes a single input, which is an entity of type T. This entity must be a subclass of BaseEntity, as specified by the constraint where T : BaseEntity. This constraint ensures that only entities with certain basic properties and behaviors can be used with this event class.

The class doesn't produce any direct outputs. Instead, it serves as a container for the inserted entity, making it available for other parts of the application to access and use as needed.

The class achieves its purpose through a simple structure:

- It has a constructor that takes the inserted entity as a parameter and stores it in a property.
- It provides a read-only property called Entity that allows access to the stored entity.

The main logic flow in this class is straightforward:

- When a new entity is inserted, an instance of EntityInsertedEvent<T> is created.
- The inserted entity is passed to the constructor.
- The constructor stores the entity in the Entity property.
- Other parts of the application can then access the inserted entity through the Entity property of the event object.

This class is part of a larger event system, likely used in an application that follows the Entity Framework pattern or a similar data access approach. It allows for loose coupling between the data access layer and other parts of the application that might need to react to new entities being inserted.

By using a generic type T, this class can work with any type of entity that inherits from BaseEntity, making it flexible and reusable across different entity types in the application.
