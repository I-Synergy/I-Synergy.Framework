# TenantAwareAttribute Explanation:

The TenantAwareAttribute is a custom attribute class designed for use in a multi-tenant software system. Its purpose is to mark classes that are specific to individual tenants (users or organizations) in the system.

This attribute doesn't take any inputs or produce any outputs directly. Instead, it's used to decorate classes in the codebase, providing metadata that can be used by other parts of the system to handle tenant-specific data correctly.

When a programmer wants to use this attribute, they apply it to a class and provide a field name as a parameter. This field name is expected to represent the property or column in the class that stores the tenant identifier.

The attribute has two constant strings defined:

- TenantAnnotation: This could be used as a key to identify tenant-related annotations in the system.
- TenantIdFilterParameterName: This might be used in database queries to filter data based on the tenant ID.

The main logic of this attribute is quite simple. When it's instantiated, it takes a string parameter 'field' and stores it in the FieldName property. This FieldName can later be accessed by other parts of the system to know which field in the decorated class represents the tenant identifier.

The attribute is marked as sealed, meaning it can't be inherited by other classes. It's also restricted to be used only on classes (not methods or properties) and can't be used multiple times on the same class.

In a multi-tenant system, this attribute could be used by a framework or middleware to automatically filter data based on the current tenant, ensuring that each tenant only sees their own data. The system could look for classes marked with this attribute and use the specified FieldName to apply tenant-specific filtering in database queries or other data access operations.

Overall, this attribute serves as a way to declaratively mark classes as tenant-aware, providing a standardized approach to handling multi-tenancy in the application.
