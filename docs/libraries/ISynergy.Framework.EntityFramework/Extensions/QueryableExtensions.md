# QueryableExtensions

This code defines a static class called QueryableExtensions, which provides two helpful methods for working with queryable collections in C#, particularly when dealing with pagination.

The first method, CountPages, is designed to calculate the total number of pages needed to display a collection of items, given a specific page size. It takes two inputs: a queryable collection of any type (TEntity) and an integer representing the page size. The method first checks if the page size is valid (greater than 0). If not, it throws an exception. Then, it counts the total number of items in the collection, divides that by the page size, and rounds up to the nearest whole number. This gives us the total number of pages needed to display all items.

The second method, ToPage, is used to retrieve a specific page of items from a queryable collection. It takes three inputs: the queryable collection, the desired page number, and the page size. After checking if the inputs are valid (page number non-negative and page size greater than 0), it uses the Skip and Take methods to select the appropriate subset of items for the requested page.

Both methods are extension methods, which means they can be called directly on IQueryable objects, making them convenient to use in LINQ queries or other data retrieval scenarios.

The purpose of this code is to simplify pagination tasks when working with large datasets. It allows developers to easily calculate the total number of pages and retrieve specific pages of data without having to implement these common operations repeatedly in their code.

The main logic flow in both methods involves input validation followed by simple mathematical calculations. In CountPages, the total item count is divided by the page size and rounded up. In ToPage, the appropriate number of items are skipped based on the page number, and then the specified number of items (page size) are taken.

These methods are particularly useful in scenarios like displaying paginated results in a user interface or implementing API endpoints that return paginated data. They help manage large datasets by breaking them into manageable chunks, improving performance and user experience.
