# IBaseEntityManager

The IBaseEntityManager interface is a blueprint for managing entities in a database or data storage system. It defines a set of operations that can be performed on entities, focusing on asynchronous methods for adding, updating, and managing data.

The purpose of this interface is to provide a standardized way to interact with entities in a database, allowing for consistent data management across different parts of an application. It doesn't implement the actual logic but defines the methods that any class implementing this interface must provide.

The interface doesn't take direct inputs or produce outputs itself. Instead, it defines methods that will take inputs and produce outputs when implemented. For example, the AddItemAsync method takes an input of type TSource (which represents the data to be added) and returns a Task, which likely represents the number of affected rows or a status code.

The interface achieves its purpose by declaring a set of methods that cover common database operations. These include adding new items (AddItemAsync), updating existing items (UpdateItemAsync), and a combination of both (AddUpdateItemAsync). Each method is designed to work asynchronously, which is important for maintaining responsive applications when dealing with potentially time-consuming database operations.

An important aspect of this interface is its use of generic type parameters. Methods like AddItemAsync<TEntity, TSource> use two type parameters: TEntity represents the database entity type, and TSource represents the input data type. This allows for flexibility in how data is represented in the application versus how it's stored in the database.

The interface also includes constraints on these generic types. For example, "where TEntity : BaseEntity, new()" ensures that TEntity must inherit from BaseEntity and have a parameterless constructor. This helps maintain consistency and ensures that all entities have certain base properties or behaviors.

Overall, this interface provides a structured approach to entity management, allowing for consistent and flexible data operations across an application that uses a database or similar data storage system.
