# ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs

This code defines an extension method for adding globalization integration to an ASP.NET Core application. The purpose of this code is to make it easier for developers to set up language-related services in their web applications.

The main function in this code is called AddGlobalizationIntegration. It takes an IHostApplicationBuilder as input, which is typically used when setting up an ASP.NET Core application. The function doesn't produce a direct output, but it modifies the input builder by adding new services to it.

The function achieves its purpose by adding two important services to the application:

- IHttpContextAccessor: This service allows access to the current HTTP context, which is crucial for handling web requests and responses.
- ILanguageService: This is likely a custom service that handles language-related tasks in the application, such as managing translations or setting the current language.

The code uses the TryAddSingleton method to add these services. This method ensures that the services are only added if they haven't been registered before, preventing duplicate registrations.

The important logic flow here is that the function extends the capabilities of the IHostApplicationBuilder. When a developer calls this function on their application builder, it seamlessly integrates these globalization-related services into their application.

By providing this extension method, the code makes it simple for developers to add globalization features to their applications with just one line of code. This approach follows a common pattern in .NET known as "convention over configuration," where common setups are made easy and automatic.

In summary, this code provides a convenient way to set up language and globalization services in an ASP.NET Core application, making it easier for developers to create multilingual web applications.
