# LanguageService

This code defines a class called LanguageService, which is designed to manage language resources and provide translations for different strings in an application. The purpose of this service is to handle multiple language resources and retrieve translated strings based on a given key.

The LanguageService class has a private list called _managers, which stores ResourceManager objects. These ResourceManager objects are responsible for managing language resources for different parts of the application.

The class has a constructor that initializes the _managers list as an empty list. This list will be populated with ResourceManager objects as they are added to the service.

The AddResourceManager method allows users to add new ResourceManager objects to the service. It takes a Type parameter representing the resource type and creates a new ResourceManager object based on that type. This new ResourceManager is then added to the _managers list.

The GetString method is the main functionality of this service. It takes a string key as input and attempts to find a corresponding translated string. The method iterates through all the ResourceManager objects in the _managers list, trying to find a translation for the given key. It first attempts to get the string using the current culture, and if that fails, it tries to get the string without specifying a culture. If a translation is found, it is immediately returned. If no translation is found after checking all ResourceManager objects, the method returns the original key surrounded by square brackets (e.g., "[key]").

This LanguageService is designed to be flexible and support multiple language resources, making it easier to manage translations in a multi-language application. It provides a centralized way to retrieve translated strings based on keys, which can be used throughout the application to display text in the user's preferred language.
