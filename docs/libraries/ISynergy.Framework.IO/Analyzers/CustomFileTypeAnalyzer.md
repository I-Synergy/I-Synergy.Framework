# CustomFileTypeAnalyzer

This code defines a class called CustomFileTypeAnalyzer, which is designed to analyze custom file types based on provided definitions. The purpose of this class is to allow users to create a custom file type analyzer with different ways of providing the definitions needed for the analysis.

The CustomFileTypeAnalyzer class inherits from a base class called BaseFileTypeAnalyzer, which likely contains the core functionality for file type analysis. This custom class extends that functionality by providing three different ways to initialize the analyzer with file type definitions.

The class doesn't produce any direct outputs on its own. Instead, it sets up the analyzer with the necessary definitions, which can then be used to analyze files in other parts of the program.

There are three ways to initialize this analyzer, each represented by a different constructor:

- The first constructor takes a string parameter called definitionsFile. This string is expected to contain the actual JSON content of the definitions file, not a file path. It passes this string directly to the base class constructor.

- The second constructor takes two parameters: a filePath string and an Encoding object. This method reads the contents of the file specified by filePath using the given encoding, and then passes the file contents as a string to the base class constructor.

- The third constructor takes a Stream object called definitionStream. It reads the entire content of this stream into a string and passes that to the base class constructor.

In all three cases, the main logic flow is to take the definitions (whether provided directly as a string, read from a file, or read from a stream) and pass them to the base class constructor. This allows the user to provide the definitions in whichever format is most convenient for their use case.

The important data transformation happening here is the conversion of various input types (string, file, or stream) into a string containing the definitions, which is then used to initialize the base analyzer. This flexibility in input formats makes the CustomFileTypeAnalyzer more versatile and easier to use in different scenarios.

Overall, this class serves as a convenient wrapper around the BaseFileTypeAnalyzer, providing multiple ways to initialize it with custom file type definitions. The actual file analysis functionality would likely be implemented in the base class or used through methods that are not shown in this code snippet.
