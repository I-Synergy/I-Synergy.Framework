# PathAvailablitiyEventArgs.cs

This code defines a custom event arguments class called PathAvailablitiyEventArgs, which is used to pass information about the availability of a path in a file system or similar context.

The purpose of this class is to provide a way to communicate whether a specific path (like a file or folder location) is available or not. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to check if a path exists or is accessible before performing operations on it.

The class takes a single input: a boolean value indicating whether the path is available or not. This is passed through the constructor when creating a new instance of PathAvailablitiyEventArgs.

The output of this class is a property called PathIsAvailable, which can be read by other parts of the program to determine if the path is available.

The class achieves its purpose by simply storing the input boolean value in the PathIsAvailable property. When an instance of PathAvailablitiyEventArgs is created, the constructor sets the PathIsAvailable property to the value provided. This property can then be accessed later to retrieve the availability status.

There isn't any complex logic or data transformation happening in this class. It's a straightforward container for a single piece of information: whether a path is available or not.

The class inherits from EventArgs, which is a standard .NET class used for passing data with events. This inheritance allows PathAvailablitiyEventArgs to be used in event-driven programming scenarios, where it can carry information about path availability when an event is raised.

In summary, PathAvailablitiyEventArgs is a simple class designed to encapsulate information about path availability. It takes a boolean input, stores it, and allows other parts of a program to access this information when needed, particularly in the context of event handling.
