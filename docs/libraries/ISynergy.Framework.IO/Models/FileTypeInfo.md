# FileTypeInfo Class Explanation:

The FileTypeInfo class is designed to store and manage information about different file types. It's part of the ISynergy.Framework.IO.Models namespace, which suggests it's used in a larger framework for input/output operations.

The purpose of this class is to encapsulate various details about a file type in a single object. This can be useful when working with different file formats in an application, as it provides a structured way to access and store file type information.

The class doesn't take any direct inputs in the form of method parameters. Instead, it uses properties to store and retrieve information about a file type. These properties can be set when creating or modifying a FileTypeInfo object.

The outputs of this class are the values stored in its properties, which can be accessed by other parts of the program that need information about a specific file type.

The FileTypeInfo class achieves its purpose by defining several properties that represent different aspects of a file type:

- Name: Stores the name of the file type (e.g., "JPEG Image" or "PDF Document").
- Extension: Holds the file extension associated with this type (e.g., ".jpg" or ".pdf").
- MimeType: Contains the MIME type of the file, which is used to indicate the nature and format of a file (e.g., "image/jpeg" or "application/pdf").
- Alias: Stores alternative names for the file type.

These properties use the public get and set accessors, which means they can be read from and written to from outside the class. This allows for easy manipulation and retrieval of file type information.

The class doesn't contain any complex logic or data transformations in the shown code snippet. It's primarily a data structure to hold related information about file types. The simplicity of this design makes it easy to use and understand, especially for beginners.

By using this class, programmers can create objects that represent different file types, set their properties, and then use these objects throughout their application whenever they need to work with or reference specific file type information. This approach helps organize code and makes it easier to manage details about various file formats in a structured way.
