# BaseWatcher.cs

This code defines an abstract base class called BaseWatcher, which serves as a foundation for creating file system watchers in C#. The purpose of this class is to provide a flexible and extensible way to monitor changes in files and directories.

The BaseWatcher class is generic, taking two type parameters: TWatcher and TWatcherEventArgs. TWatcher must be a type that inherits from FileSystemWatcher and can be instantiated with a parameterless constructor. TWatcherEventArgs must be a type that inherits from BaseEventArgs. This setup allows for customization of the watcher and its event arguments.

The class doesn't take any direct inputs, but it's designed to be inherited from and used as a base for more specific watcher implementations. It doesn't produce any direct outputs either, but instead, it sets up a system for raising events when file system changes occur.

The BaseWatcher class achieves its purpose by defining a series of events that can be triggered when various file system changes happen. These events include changes to file attributes, creation time, directory name, file name, last access time, last write time, security settings, and file size. It also includes events for when files are created, deleted, or renamed, as well as events for errors and when the watcher is disposed.

Each event is defined using a custom delegate called WatcherEventHandler, which takes an object sender and a TWatcherEventArgs parameter. This allows users of the class to attach custom event handlers to respond to specific file system changes.

The important logic flow in this code is the setup of these events. By defining these events, the BaseWatcher class creates a framework for notifying interested parties about various file system changes. This is crucial for applications that need to react to changes in the file system in real-time.

While this code doesn't show the implementation of how these events are triggered, it sets up the structure for a comprehensive file system monitoring system. Developers using this class can focus on responding to the events they're interested in, without having to worry about the low-level details of how file system changes are detected.
