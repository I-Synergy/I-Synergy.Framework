# Watcher

The Watcher class in src\ISynergy.Framework.IO\Watchers\Watcher.cs is a simple implementation of a file system watcher. Its purpose is to monitor changes in a specified directory or file on the file system.

This class is designed to be a part of a larger framework for handling input/output operations, specifically for watching file system changes. It inherits from a base class called BaseWatcher, which likely provides most of the functionality for watching file system events.

The Watcher class takes one input: a WatcherInfo object. This object probably contains information about what directory or file to watch, and possibly other configuration details for the watcher.

As for outputs, the class doesn't directly produce any. However, being a watcher, it's designed to raise events when file system changes occur. These events would be handled by other parts of the program that are interested in file system changes.

The class achieves its purpose by utilizing the FileSystemWatcher class, which is a built-in .NET class for monitoring file system events. The Watcher class wraps this functionality, likely adding some additional features or making it easier to use within the context of the ISynergy framework.

There isn't much complex logic or data transformation happening in this specific code snippet. The class is quite simple, with just a constructor that takes a WatcherInfo object and passes it to the base class constructor.

The important thing to understand here is that this class is part of a larger system. It's designed to be instantiated with some watching information, and then it will monitor the file system based on that information. When changes occur, it will likely raise events that other parts of the program can listen for and respond to.

This kind of functionality is useful in many scenarios, such as monitoring a folder for new files, detecting when files are modified, or triggering actions when files are deleted. It's a common pattern in file-based data processing systems, backup software, or any application that needs to stay synchronized with the state of the file system.
