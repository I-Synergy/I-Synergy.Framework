# IFileTypeAnalyzer Interface

This code defines an interface called IFileTypeAnalyzer, which is designed to analyze and provide information about different file types. The purpose of this interface is to create a standard set of methods that any class implementing it must provide, ensuring consistency in file type analysis across different parts of a program.

The interface doesn't take any direct inputs or produce any outputs itself. Instead, it defines methods that, when implemented, will handle various aspects of file type analysis. These methods are designed to work with file extensions, MIME types, and file contents.

The interface includes several methods:

- GetAvailableExtensions(): This method is intended to return a list of file extensions that the analyzer supports. For example, it might return extensions like ".txt", ".jpg", or ".pdf".

- GetAvailableMimeTypes(): Similar to the previous method, this one is meant to return a list of MIME types that the analyzer can work with. MIME types are standardized ways to describe the nature and format of a file, like "text/plain" for text files or "image/jpeg" for JPEG images.

- GetMimeTypeByExtension(string extension): This method takes a file extension as input and is expected to return the corresponding MIME type. For instance, if given ".jpg", it might return "image/jpeg".

- AvailableTypes: This is a property that should provide a collection of FileTypeInfo objects. These objects likely contain detailed information about each file type the analyzer supports.

The interface doesn't specify how these methods should be implemented. That's left up to the classes that will implement this interface. The idea is that any class implementing IFileTypeAnalyzer will provide its own logic for these methods, but they will all follow this common structure.

By defining this interface, the code sets up a framework for consistent file type analysis. This can be useful in scenarios where a program needs to handle multiple file types, such as in a file management system or a document processing application. It allows for easy extension of file type support and ensures that all file type analyzers in the system will have the same basic capabilities.
