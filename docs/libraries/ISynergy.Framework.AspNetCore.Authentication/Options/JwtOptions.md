# JwtOptions.cs

This code defines a class called JwtOptions, which is designed to store configuration settings for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) in an ASP.NET Core application. JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications.

The purpose of this code is to create a structure for holding three important pieces of information related to JWT configuration: the symmetric key secret, the issuer, and the audience. These properties are essential for creating and validating JWTs in the application.

The JwtOptions class doesn't take any inputs directly, as it's a simple data container. Instead, it provides properties that can be set and retrieved by other parts of the application. It also doesn't produce any outputs on its own; its role is to store and provide access to the JWT configuration data.

The class achieves its purpose by declaring three public properties:

- SymmetricKeySecret: This property stores the secret key used to sign and verify JWTs. It's crucial for ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the tokens.

- Issuer: This property holds the name of the entity that issues the JWTs. It helps identify the source of the tokens.

- Audience: This property stores the intended recipient or audience for the JWTs. It can be used to ensure that tokens are only accepted by the appropriate services or applications.

Each of these properties is of type string and is initialized with an empty string (string.Empty) as a default value. This ensures that the properties always have a valid value, even if they haven't been explicitly set.

The class doesn't contain any complex logic or data transformations. Its primary function is to group related JWT configuration settings together in a single, organized structure. This makes it easier for other parts of the application to access and manage these settings consistently.

By using this JwtOptions class, developers can easily configure and modify JWT settings in their application. They can create an instance of this class, set the required values for each property, and then use this instance wherever JWT configuration is needed throughout the application.
