# DocumentRequest.cs

This code defines a class called DocumentRequest that is designed to handle requests for generating documents with mail-merge capabilities. The class is generic, meaning it can work with different types of document data (TDocument) and detail data (TDetails).

The purpose of this code is to create a structure for organizing all the necessary information needed to generate a document. It takes various inputs, including a template, stationery image, and different sets of data for mail-merge operations.

The class doesn't produce any direct output itself. Instead, it serves as a container for holding all the required data that will be used by other parts of the system to generate the final document.

The DocumentRequest class achieves its purpose by providing properties to store different types of data:

- Template: This is stored as a byte array and represents the base document template.
- Stationery: Also stored as a byte array, this likely represents a background image or letterhead for the document.
- Document: This is a collection of TDocument objects, which probably contain the main data for the document.
- DocumentDetails: A collection of TDetails objects, likely containing additional information for the document.
- DocumentAlternatives: Another collection of TDetails objects, possibly representing alternative or optional content.

The class uses default values for some properties. For example, Template and Stationery are initialized with empty byte arrays, and Document is initialized with an empty collection. This ensures that these properties always have a valid value, even if not explicitly set.

The main logic flow in this code is the organization of data. It separates different types of information (template, stationery, main document data, details, and alternatives) into distinct properties. This separation allows for flexible document generation, where different parts of the document can be populated or modified independently.

In summary, this DocumentRequest class acts as a structured container for all the data needed to generate a document with mail-merge capabilities. It doesn't process the data itself but provides a organized way to pass all necessary information to other parts of the system that will handle the actual document generation.
