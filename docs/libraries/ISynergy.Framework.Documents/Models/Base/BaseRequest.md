# BaseRequest.cs

This code defines a basic structure for making requests in a document-related application. It's a simple building block that other, more specific request types can use as a starting point.

The purpose of this code is to create a foundation for different kinds of document requests. It does this by defining an abstract class called BaseRequest. An abstract class is like a template that other classes can build upon, adding their own specific features while still keeping the basic structure defined here.

The BaseRequest class doesn't take any inputs directly, but it does have one property that can be set: FileName. This property is meant to store the name of a file that the request is associated with. It's a string, which means it can hold text like "document.pdf" or "spreadsheet.xlsx".

As for outputs, this class doesn't produce any on its own. Instead, it's designed to be used as part of larger systems where other code will create instances of classes that inherit from BaseRequest and then use or manipulate the FileName property.

The code achieves its purpose by declaring a simple structure with just one property. It doesn't contain any complex logic or algorithms. Instead, it serves as a starting point for other, more specific request types that might need additional properties or methods.

There aren't any important logic flows or data transformations happening in this code. It's a straightforward declaration of a class with a single property. The main idea is that any class that inherits from BaseRequest will automatically have a FileName property, ensuring consistency across different types of requests in the application.

In summary, this code sets up a basic structure for document-related requests, providing a common element (the file name) that all requests in the system are expected to have. It's a simple but important piece of the overall application architecture, helping to standardize how file-related requests are handled throughout the program.
