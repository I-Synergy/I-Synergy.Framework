# IDocumentService

The IDocumentService interface, defined in the file IDocumentService.cs, is designed to provide a blueprint for generating document streams, specifically for Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and Microsoft Word or PDF documents. This interface is part of a framework for handling document-related operations.

The purpose of this code is to define a contract that any class implementing this interface must follow. It outlines two main operations: generating Excel sheets and generating Word or PDF documents.

For generating Excel sheets, the interface declares a method called GenerateExcelSheetAsync. This method takes two inputs: a SpreadsheetRequest object (which likely contains the data and formatting information for the Excel sheet) and an optional CancellationToken (used for cancelling long-running operations). The output of this method is a Task containing a Stream, which represents the generated Excel document in a format that can be easily saved or transmitted.

Similarly, for generating Word or PDF documents, the interface declares a method called GenerateDocumentAsync. This method takes three inputs: a DocumentRequest object (containing the content and structure of the document), a boolean flag to indicate whether to export as PDF, and an optional CancellationToken. Like the Excel method, this also returns a Task containing a Stream of the generated document.

The interface doesn't provide the actual implementation of these methods - that would be done in a class that implements this interface. Instead, it sets up a structure that ensures any implementing class will have these methods available, making it easier to work with different document generation implementations in a consistent way.

The use of generic type parameters (T, TDocument, TDetails) in the method signatures suggests that these methods can work with different types of data structures, providing flexibility in how the document content is organized and passed to the methods.

By defining these operations as asynchronous (using Task), the interface allows for non-blocking document generation, which is important for maintaining responsiveness in applications, especially when dealing with large documents or slow I/O operations.

Overall, this interface provides a standardized way to generate Excel, Word, and PDF documents from data, allowing developers to create document-generating services that can be easily swapped or extended while maintaining a consistent API.
